      <comment>/* Who are this wiki's administrators? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2785">Different users have access to different functions of the site. While anyone can do most things on the site, including reading and editing, '''administrators''' can access a few additional functions. 

*Deleting and undeleting pages and page histories. Administrators can also delete uploaded files, but cannot undelete them.
*Locking (protecting) a page so it can not be edited or renamed by users without admin rights.
*Blocking IP addresses or user names from editing; and very quick &quot;rollback&quot; of undesirable edits.
*Editing the interface by changing system messages and skins.

A '''bureaucrat''' can make other users into bureaucrats or administrators on their own wiki. They are not currently able to remove admin access from any user. Please contact one of the community staff if you need this done.

Some Wikia staff members have full access to all Wikia. They will be shown in [[Special:Listusers/staff]] on any wiki. Please see the Central Wikia [[Wikia:Contact us|contact page]] for details on how to contact Wikia staff.

==Who are this wiki's administrators?==
The &quot;founder&quot; of a wiki, the person who first requested it, is given administrator access automatically. Founders are also given bureaucrat access so they can make any other user on their wiki an administrator or bureaucrat. For a complete list of users with administrator access, see [[Special:Listadmins]].

You may also wish to list them on this page.

*[[User:Dizzymisscindie]]

==How do I use administrator powers?==
See the [[Help:Administrators' how-to guide|administrators' how-to guide]] for a guide on using admin functions.

==Becoming an administrator==
For you to become an administrator, someone with bureaucrat access must make you one. On larger Wikias, there will usually be a community page for requests, with a page name such as &quot;[[{{ns:project}}:Requests for adminship]]&quot;. On a smaller wiki, you may simply ask on the community portal or ask a bureaucrat directly on his or her talk page.

If there are no active bureaucrats and you wish to become an administrator, please contact the [[Wikia:Community support|community staff on the Central Wikia.]]

==What can administrators not do?==
Administrators should not use their administrator powers to settle editing disputes; for example, to lock a page on a version he or she prefers in an editing dispute that isn't vandalism. Administrator powers should be use to help keep the wiki clear of vandalism, spam, and users who make malicious edits, but not for simple disagreements between users acting in good faith.  Idealy an admin shouldn't be considered &quot;in charge&quot;. The ideal admin is just someone who is trusted to have a few extra buttons and to use them for the benefit of the Wikia community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2183">[[Project:Administrators|Administrators]] can '''protect''' and unprotect pages. Protection of a page or image means that a non-admin cannot modify it.

The majority of pages on all Wikia should remain publicly editable, and '''not protected'''. Pages may, however, be temporarily or permanently protected for legal reasons (for example, license texts should not be changed) or in cases of extreme vandalism or edit warring. 

==Uses==

*Protecting highly vandalised pages, such as the [[Main Page]] on large wikis.
*Maintaining the integrity of the site's logo and favicon.
*Maintaining the integrity of key [[Project:copyrights|copyright]] and license pages.
*Protecting the interface and system messages in the MediaWiki namespace (these are protected automatically)

A '''temporary''' protection is used for:
*Enforcing a &quot;cool down&quot; period to stop an &quot;edit war&quot;, upon request.
*Protecting a page or image that has been a recent target of ''persistent'' vandalism or ''persistent'' edits by a banned user. 

There is no need to protect personal .css and .js pages like user/monobook.css or user/cologneblue.js. Only the accounts associated with these pages (and admins) are able to edit them. (For more information on using these pages, see the [[Wikia:Help:User style|help page on Central]]

==Rules==
#Do not make the common mistake of protecting pages unnecessarily. For example, do not protect a page simply because it is the Main Page.
#Do not [[Help:Editing|edit]] a temporarily protected page except to add a notice explaining the page is protected.
#Do not protect a page you are involved in an edit dispute over. Admin powers are not editor privileges - admins should only act as servants to the user community at large. 
#Avoid favoring one version of the article over another, unless one version is vandalism. 
#Temporarily protected pages should not be left protected for very long.
#Talk pages and user talk pages are not protected except in extreme circumstances.
#The protection of a page on any particular version is not meant to express support for that version and requests should therefore not be made that the protected version be reverted to a different one.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]], the free encyclopedia, is the largest and most successful wiki.  This page lists some of the overarching guidelines that have helped make Wikipedia a success.  You may like to consider them for this Wikia.

# '''BE BOLD!''' in updating pages. Go ahead, it's a wiki! &lt;br /&gt;Encourage others, including those who disagree with you, likewise to  '''BE BOLD!'''
# '''Be civil''' to other users at all times.
# '''Ignore all rules'''. If the rules discourage you from improving or maintaining the wiki's quality, ignore them.
# '''When in doubt, take it to the [[Help:Talk page|talk page]]'''. We have all the time in the world. Mutual respect is the guiding behavioural principle of Wikia and, although everyone knows that their writing may be edited mercilessly, it is easier to accept changes if the reasons for them are understood. If you discuss changes on the article's ''talk'' (or ''discussion'') page  before you make them, you should reach consensus faster and happier. 
#'''[[Project:Copyrights|Respect copyright]]'''. Wikia uses the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License GNU Free Documentation License]. Everything you contribute must be compatible with that license. 
# '''Decent edit summaries''' and clear and transparent explanations are universally appreciated. Other editors need to understand your process, and it also helps you yourself to understand what you did after a long leave of absence from an article. Please state '''''what''''' you changed and '''''why'''''. If the explanation is too long, add more on the discussion page.
#'''Assume good faith'''; in other words, try to consider the person on the other end of the discussion is a thinking, rational being who is trying to positively contribute to the project — unless, and only unless, you have firm, solid, and objective proof to the contrary. Merely disagreeing with you is no such proof. 
#Particularly, '''don't revert good faith edits'''. [[Help:Reverting|Reverting]] is a little ''too'' powerful sometimes. Don't succumb to the temptation, unless you're reverting very obvious vandalism &lt;small&gt;(like &quot;LALALALAL*&amp;*@#@THIS_SUX0RZ&quot;, or someone changing &quot;1+2=3&quot; to &quot;1+2='''17'''&quot;)&lt;/small&gt;. If you really can't stand something, revert once, with an edit summary something like &quot;(rv) I disagree strongly, I'll explain why in talk.&quot;  and immediately take it to talk.
# '''No personal attacks'''. Don't write that user such and so is an idiot, or insult him/her (even if (s)he ''is'' an idiot). Instead, explain what they did wrong, why it is wrong, and how to fix it. If possible, fix it yourself (but see above).
# '''Be graceful''': ''Be liberal in what you accept, be conservative in what you do''. Try to accommodate other people's quirks the best you can, but try to be as polite, solid and straightforward as possible yourself.
# '''Sign your posts on talk pages''' using &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; which gets replaced by your username and timestamp when you hit submit.  But don't sign on mainspace articles.
# '''Use the preview button'''; it prevents edit conflicts.

It's important to have fun... but try to make sure those around you have fun too!

Welcome to the '''{{SITENAME}}'s sandbox'''!&lt;br /&gt;
This page exists so that you can practice editing or formatting (see [[Help:Editing|Editing help]]) without changing any serious content.  Feel free to try wiki editing out here first.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a [[wikia:Help:Tutorial_1|tutorial]] on the Central (coordinating) Wikia that will step you through more of the things you can do.  Wiki allow for rather complicated formatting.  It can look overwhelming when you begin, but don't let it worry you.  Just start with the basics... enter some text, and learn the other pieces as you go.  Your content contributions are welcome and important.  The wiki is a collaborative effort and others can help with formatting and other improvements.&lt;br /&gt;
Best wishes!

Welcome to our wiki! We hope you can make continuing contributions of articles and/or discussion and other improvements. 

If you are new to Wikia or wikis in general, be sure to visit the [[project:Community Portal|&quot;Community portal&quot;]] for an outline of some of the main parts of the site and a link to pages that tell you '''how to edit'''.

Do keep an eye on the [[Special:Recentchanges|&quot;recent changes&quot; page]], where all edits and their authors (anonymous or signed-in) are listed. Bookmark it, maybe. (And help delete spam - unpleasant but a fact of life.)

'''Discussion''' of any aspect of the site, '''and enquiries''', can be made at [[Talk:Main_Page]] or on the [[Help:Talk page|&quot;discussion&quot; page]] associated with each article. It helps if you sign and date your contributions there, so that readers know &quot;who to talk to&quot; and whether your message is probably still of current interest. If you write on a user's &quot;talk&quot; page, that user will get an alerting message on next visit.

(''It would help some of us to know how you discovered this site.'')


Enjoy!</text>

      <comment>How to use it and copy it etc</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1179">==How to use the template==
Just type &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:welc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on a user's Talk page then add your signature. As soon as you Save, the entry will lose its link to the template and become ordinary text, which you can edit to personalise it.

==Use of &quot;subst:&quot; prefix==
Using the prefix before any template name copies the template then cuts the connexion. If you omit the &quot;subst:&quot; the result copies just the same but will not be editable and will always show the current version of the template - probably not a good idea for a one-off welcoming message although it is useful for many other templates.

==Edit it to make it more specific to the wiki==
For example, it could say &quot;Welcome to the '''&lt;font color=blue&gt;XYZWV Wiki&lt;/font&gt;'''&quot;. Maybe add a link to a page you particularly want new users to look at.

==Make another one just for you to use==
On your user page you could create a link to something like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[template:welcJG]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; then make the resulting page a copy of [[template:welc]] and modify it any way you like. Then you can type or paste &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:welcJG}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on a newcomer's page and not need further personalising.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="532">This is our top-level category. (Looking at it another way, it is our root category!)

Ideally, every other category should be a subcategory of at least one other, and every article should be in at least one category; many will fit well into two (eg location and subject-matter). A full list of existing categories can be found at [[Special:Categories]].

To add a new category, just add &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:categoryname]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the article or existing category page  (after checking whether any existing category is suitable).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1343">This category is intended to contain all the &quot;help&quot; pages for this Wikia: pages that can help contributors and/or readers. Most, but not all, have &quot;Help:&quot; at the beginning of their page names and are therefore in the &quot;Help&quot; namespace; an automatically-generated list of those can be found at [[Special:Allpages]] by running down the &quot;Namespace&quot; menu. Many wikis also make much use of a [[Help:Contents]] page, where headings and tables may be used to cover the main areas, in contrast to a [[Special:Categories|category]], which is fairly rigidly based on alphabetical order.

If you find helpful pages that you think should be here, you may include them here just by typing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:help]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on them.

You can also:
* ask questions at the [[Forum:Index|forum]]
* talk to one of the [[Special:Listadmins|site administrators]] or any currently active contributor (the people whose names appear on [[Special:Recentchanges|the &quot;Recent changes&quot; page]]); use their User Talk pages.

If you can't find what you need on this wiki, you can seek help at the [[Wikia:Wikia|Central Wikia]].  There are more help pages at [[Wikia:Category:Help]], and you can use the [[Wikia:Forum:Index|Central forum]].  

If you still need help, you may want to contact the [[Wikia:Community support|Wikia community support team]].

      <comment>Hello to everyone</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="649">Needed to create you one little bit of observation to finally thank you once again considering the exceptional views you've featured above. It was really extremely generous of you to present unreservedly just what many of us would've made available for an e book in making some profit on their own, chiefly now that you could have done it in case you decided. Those ideas as well worked to be the great way to fully grasp that most people have the identical dreams just as my personal own to know the truth a great deal more with regard to this matter. I'm certain there are millions of more fun sessions up front for folks who look over your forum.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3087">The rules of this wiki are simple, but please follow them!

# '''BE BOLD!''' in updating pages. Go ahead, it's a wiki! &lt;br /&gt;Encourage others, including those who disagree with you, likewise to  '''BE BOLD!'''
# '''Be civil''' to other users at all times.
# '''Ignore all rules'''. If the rules discourage you from improving or maintaining the wiki's quality, ignore them.
# '''When in doubt, take it to the [[Help:Talk page|talk page]]'''. We have all the time in the world. Mutual respect is the guiding behavioural principle of Wikia and, although everyone knows that their writing may be edited mercilessly, it is easier to accept changes if the reasons for them are understood. If you discuss changes on the article's ''talk'' (or ''discussion'') page  before you make them, you should reach consensus faster and happier. 
#'''[[Copyright Policy|Respect copyright]]'''. Wikia uses the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License GNU Free Documentation License]. Everything you contribute must be compatible with that license. 
# '''Decent edit summaries''' and clear and transparent explanations are universally appreciated. Other editors need to understand your process, and it also helps you yourself to understand what you did after a long leave of absence from an article. Please state '''''what''''' you changed and '''''why'''''. If the explanation is too long, add more on the discussion page.
#'''Assume good faith'''; in other words, try to consider the person on the other end of the discussion is a thinking, rational being who is trying to positively contribute to the project — unless, and only unless, you have firm, solid, and objective proof to the contrary. Merely disagreeing with you is no such proof. 
#Particularly, '''don't revert good faith edits'''. [[Help:Reverting|Reverting]] is a little ''too'' powerful sometimes. Don't succumb to the temptation, unless you're reverting very obvious vandalism &lt;small&gt;(like &quot;LALALALAL*&amp;*@#@THIS_SUX0RZ&quot;, or someone changing &quot;1+2=3&quot; to &quot;1+2='''17'''&quot;)&lt;/small&gt;. If you really can't stand something, revert once, with an edit summary something like &quot;(rv) I disagree strongly, I'll explain why in talk.&quot;  and immediately take it to talk.
# '''No personal attacks'''. Don't write that user such and so is an idiot, or insult him/her (even if (s)he ''is'' an idiot). Instead, explain what they did wrong, why it is wrong, and how to fix it. If possible, fix it yourself (but see above).
# '''Be graceful''': ''Be liberal in what you accept, be conservative in what you do''. Try to accommodate other people's quirks the best you can, but try to be as polite, solid and straightforward as possible yourself.
# '''Sign your posts on talk pages''' using &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; which gets replaced by your username and timestamp when you hit submit.  But don't sign on mainspace articles.
# '''Use the preview button'''; it prevents edit conflicts.

It's important to have fun... but try to make sure those around you have fun too!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1315">Wikipedia defines a spoiler as a:

: ''[S]ummary or description of a narrative (or part of a narrative) that relates plot elements not revealed early in the narrative itself. Moreover, because enjoyment of the plot depends on dramatic tension and suspense, this early revelation of plot elements &quot;spoils&quot; the enjoyment that consumers of the narrative would otherwise have experienced.''


Spoilers may pose a problem for many visitors who've yet to view all of the episodes.  ''Gilmore Girls'' is to aired all over the world and some countries may not have seen all of the episodes. The policy at the '''Gilmore Girls Wiki''' is that information from any episode that has had it's first airing anywhere in the world is fair game for inclusion on this site.  Currently, this means 8:00 P.M. EST in the United States on Tuesdays, (However, information may be added if the episode airs earlier at a special time, or on a special day that is prior to Tuesday at 8:00 P.M.).  Viewers watching the show at later dates or times are cautioned when browsing this site, again, because it will contain spoilers.  '''Spoiler warnings are ''NOT'' given for already aired episodes.'''

In general, information from unaired episodes is ''not'' to be included on the '''Gilmore Girls Wiki'''.

&lt;!--COMMENT  Please do not make any changes above this line.  
                         Feel free to make any changes below.
                         This is the sandbox where you can play and try out wiki editing safely. --&gt;

This page is for any tests.

Welcome to the sandbox!

Anyone can edit this.

==Simple Editing==

To edit a page, click on the &quot;edit&quot; tab, usually near the top of the page.  Then, edit the box in the page.  Feel free to practice here, on this page.  It's here just for you to practice.

A blank line indicates a paragraph separation.

You can link to another page by putting the name or title of that page in double square brackets. 
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Main Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; becomes [[Main Page]].

==Simple Formatting==

Create headers by putting text inbetween repeated equal (=) signs.  The more =, the lower level the heading is.

Create a bulleted list by starting each item with an asterick (*)
* it's ok to make editing mistakes
* you can preview your work before saving it
* even after saving it, you or someone else can edit it again to make it even better

==Formatting for Emphasis==

Put single quote marks around words or phrases for formatting emphasis.

Two single quotes, like &lt;nowiki&gt;''italics''&lt;/nowiki&gt; will create ''italics''.

Three single quotes, like &lt;nowiki&gt;'''bold text'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; will create '''bold text'''.

----
Other stuff...

If you know HTML or CSS formatting commands, they can also be used in this wiki.  One useful HTML command is &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; which creates a line break.

If you want to show what a command looks like, rather than actually implementing the command, surround it with the '''nowiki''' command.</text>

Lorelai, Rory and Emily take a road trip to North Carolina to attend Mia's wedding, and Lane goes into labor.

==Summary==

[[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] plans a road trip to North Carolina to attend the wedding of [[Mia]], the woman who took in Lorelai and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] and served as a surrogate mother/grandmother for many years. Rory has a fight with [[Logan Huntzberger|Logan]] over his immature reaction to his business disaster, and agrees to go on the trip with Lorelai. [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] invites herself along in an effort to get away from [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]], who is driving her crazy while he recuperates at home. At the wedding, Emily is upset by the close relationship Mia shares with Lorelai and Rory. Lorelai learns that Emily came to see Mia five years earlier to ask for pictures of Lorelai and Rory during the years they were estranged. Logan makes a surprise appearance and asks Rory to forgive him. Meanwhile, [[Lane Kim|Lane]] and [[Zack Van Gerbig|Zack]] ask [[Luke Danes|Luke]] to be the godfather to their twins. Finally, Lane goes into labor and Luke helps get everyone to the hospital.

While she is in the midst of planning [[Lane Kim|Lane's]] baby shower, [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] gets a long-awaited call from The New York Times offering her an informational interview.

At Friday night dinner, [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] works up the courage to tell her parents about the break-up of her marriage, but is derailed by their argument over the healthy meals and no-alcohol policy [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] has instituted to help [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] recover from his heart attack.

The Gilmore Girls spend the day in the hospital waiting for word on Richard, and while Logan and Luke come to their aid, Lorelai can't get a hold of Christopher. 

==Summary==

In the hospital waiting room, [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]], [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] and [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] anxiously await word on [[Richard Gilmore|Richard’s]] condition. When [[Logan Huntzberger|Logan]] hears what is happening, he borrows a helicopter to be by Rory’s side, but Lorelai is unable to reach [[Christopher Hayden|Christopher]], who is still angry over their fight the night before. Upset by Emily’s attempt to remain calm by dealing with her social calendar, Lorelai is relieved when [[Luke Danes|Luke]] shows up unannounced and volunteers to run errands for Emily. Christopher finally arrives to be with Lorelai, but the scene at the hospital is more than he can take when he sees Lorelai talking to Luke.

Rory saves the day at the Yale Daily News, and Friday Night Dinner explodes as all four attendees air their grievances.

==Summary==

While [[Luke Danes|Luke]] deals with the reality of having [[April Nardini|April]] in his life, [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] tries to pretend she doesn't mind the repercussions the new situation is having on their engagement. [[Rory Gilmore|Rory's]] concern over [[Paris Gellar|Paris']] lack of management skills at the [[Yale Daily News]] finally reaches a crisis point when most of the staff quits in protest. With [[Logan Huntzberger|Logan's]] help, Rory makes a valiant attempt to get the paper out on time. Meanwhile, Lorelai breaks the news to [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] that their money will no longer be needed for Rory's education, and the resentment starts to build. The subsequent Friday night dinner erupts into an emotional confrontation where all four Gilmores finally get their issues out on the table.

Rory decides not to return to Yale, and though Lorelai seemingly convinces her parents to help her change Rory's mind, they end up allowing Rory to live in the poolhouse.

==Summary==

After receiving a call from her, [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] goes to pick [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] up from the police station and takes her home. While on the way home [[Logan Huntzberger|Logan]] calls Rory and Lorelai orders her not to talk to him and she does anyway. Rory explains that the boat theft was not Logan's idea and Lorelai should not blame him. Lorelai goes to [[Luke Danes|Luke]] and freaks out about what to do and how to act and Luke plays the fatherly type toward Rory while talking to Lorelai. Logan finds out that [[Mitchum Huntzberger|his father]] upset Rory and says he will have a talk with his father, but Rory begs him not to. Rory tells Lorelai that she decided she won't be going back to Yale next year. Lorelai doesn't like this idea and goes to her parents for help. Somewhere in between, Rory goes to her grandparents house to talk to them about her situation and ends up convincing them to support her decision. They then tell Lorelai that Rory will be living in their poolhouse until she decides she wants to go back to Yale. On the other hand, [[Mrs. Kim]] helps [[Lane Kim|Lane]] and her band get gigs and stay together. The season ends with a proposal from Lorelai.

'''Lorelai Victoria Gilmore''' is played by [[Lauren Graham]]. She was named after her paternal grandmother, [[Lorelai &quot;Trix&quot; Gilmore]], and is mother to [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]].

Raised in Hartford, Connecticut, Lorelai is a highly talkative, free-spirited woman, a child of the eighties and part of the MTV generation. She was born on April 26, 1968.

Her wealthy parents, [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]], raised her to be a proper young lady of good breeding. They had her future all planned and arranged for her to come out to society after her sixteenth birthday, but Lorelai was always rebellious and resentful of her structured, sheltered and silver spoon upbringing and became pregnant. Shortly after Rory's birth, she left home, which further put on a strain in her relationship with her parents.

==Character traits==
Lorelai's eating habits are famously unhealthy; she is a caffeine addict and subsists mostly on diner food and takeout. She and Rory had regular food-and-movie nights (in the early seasons), during which they would buy enough junk food for several people and proceed to eat most of it. The only time she is noted to have desired fruit and vegetables was when she was pregnant with Rory. She does not cook; when not eating leftover takeout or junk food, she frequents Luke's diner. Rory and Lorelai usually enjoy breakfast at Luke's daily, and sometimes eat lunch or dinner there as well. For those times when Lorelai is required to prepare something domestically, such as the Chilton bake sale, she turns to her chef friend, [[Sookie St. James]], to do the cooking ([[Cinnamon's Wake]]).

Lorelai is innately humorous and has a witty remark for every situation, often with a pop culture reference. Her remarks can either confuse or charm those who aren't familiar with her. She is also known for being very talkative and having a way with words; [[Max Medina]] calls her a &quot;wordsmith&quot; (Cinnamon's Wake). Additionally, as the manager of the [[Independence Inn]], she is able to think quickly on her feet and handle various situations, such as improvising rooms for people when the inn catches fire ([[A Tale of Poes and Fire]]).

==Beginnings==
As a teenager (played in flashbacks by [[Chelsea Brummet]]), Lorelai dated [[Christopher Hayden]], son of [[Straub Hayden|Straub]] and [[Francine Hayden]], while in high school, (whom she met at age 6, who soon became her best friend), and became pregnant right before her society debut (at age 16), which embarrassed and disappointed her parents. Although she usually defends her circumstances, deep down she knows how they felt. &lt;ref name=&quot;humiliation&quot;&gt;'''Lorelai:''' I humiliated them. The two proudest people in the world and I humiliated them. I spoiled their plans. I took their fine upbringing in a world of comfort and opportunity and I threw it in their faces. I broke their hearts and they'll never forgive me. I guess I can't expect them to. Season 2, Ep. 21 &quot;[[Lorelai's Graduation Day]]&quot; She was graduating from the business college she had been attending)&lt;/ref&gt; After Straub tried to convince Emily and Richard to have Lorelai have an abortion, Emily completely refused, and they decided to have them marry instead. Christopher was amenable, but Lorelai realized they weren't ready. Lorelai is known for being stronger and more independent than Christopher; when she realized she was in labor, she drove herself to the hospital despite not having a driver's license.

After her daughter, [[Rory Gilmore|Lorelai &quot;Rory&quot; Leigh Gilmore]], was born&lt;ref name=&quot;principal&quot;&gt;'''Lorelai:''' I'm Lorelai Gilmore. This is my daughter, Lorelai Gilmore... 'cause I named her after me. I was in the hospital all whacked out on [Demerol. Never mind. Um, but we call her Rory. It's short for Lorelai, but she'll answer to either one, or even &quot;Hey, you&quot; depending on the... is the Headmaster here? Season1, Ep. 2 &quot;[[The Lorelais' First Day at Chilton]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;, she lived with her parents for a year before running away to find a job at the [[Independence Inn]] in [[Stars Hollow]]. The owner of the inn, [[Mia]], took her in, gave her a job as a maid, and let her and Rory live in the back in a renovated potting shed.&lt;ref name=&quot;inn&quot;&gt;'''Rory:''' I know it looks small, but it's really pretty. Come on. See, we had our bed right over there, and mom put up this really pretty curtain around the tub so that it looked like a real bathroom. And we would just sit outside at night when the inn would have parties and we'd just listen to music and feed the ducks and...&quot; Season 1, Ep. 19 &quot;[[Emily In Wonderland (Episode 1.19)|Emily in Wonderland]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Lorelai was very efficient at her job, and gradually worked her way up over the years to the manager position. The inn is where she met her best friend, [[Sookie St. James]].

Lorelai attended [[Hartford]] Community College and earned an Associate of Arts degree in business while running the Independence Inn. After the inn burned down, she and Sookie owned and operated the [[Independence Catering Company]] in order to fund renovation of the [[Dragonfly Inn]], their long-term dream, which opened to rave reviews on May 6 during [[Season 4]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dragonfly&gt;'''Michel:''' But you wrote [the first reservation] down on a gum wrapper. '''Lorelai:''' So? '''Michel:''' It's embarrassing. This is an historical document. '''Sookie:''' Who cares what she wrote it on? '''Michel:''' Big Red wrapper. '''Sookie:''' Juicyfruit would have been better? '''Michel:''' Well, I'm going to go out and get a value pack for when things really start getting busy around here. Season 4, Ep. 14 &quot;[[The Incredible Shrinking Lorelais]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family life ==
For many years, Lorelai had almost no contact with her parents, except for visits during major holidays. The rebelliousness of her teen years stayed with her in adulthood. As they both grew up, Lorelai and Rory's relationship evolved into the relationship of two best friends or sisters, rather than a parent to her child. Lorelai stated the fact that their relationship was best friends first, mother daughter second. Lorelai would only use the &quot;mom card&quot; as a last resort. It wasn't until she needed to borrow a very large sum of money for Rory's education at the exclusive [[Chilton Preparatory School|Chilton Academy]] that she bowed down to her parents and started seeing them regularly at the mandatory &quot;Friday night dinners&quot;.

Lorelai repaid her parents for the loan when a real estate investment that Richard had made in her name at the time of her birth paid off, but Rory also made her own bargain with her grandparents for [[Yale]] tuition. Lorelai continued to attend occasional Friday night dinners, partly as a way to see Rory while she was busy at college.

Lorelai is somewhat insecure when it comes to the relationships between herself, her parents, and Rory. Because her daughter gets along better with her grandparents than she herself ever did, Lorelai often feels that her parents prefer Rory over her. She thinks they view Rory, who is considerably more subdued and more classically &quot;feminine&quot; than her mother, as the daughter they should have had. This seemed very evident when Rory moved in with her grandparents who welcome her with open arms following a rift between Rory and Lorelai after Rory attempted to steal a yacht and dropped out of Yale. Her fears were further cemented when Rory adapted very well to her grandparents' lifestyle, even joining the DAR. Lorelai and Rory later reconcile when Emily becomes too controlling of Rory's life, as she was of Lorelai's.

By the end of the series, Rory goes off to Iowa to begin a career reporting for an online magazine following Barack Obama on his campaign trail. Emily believes that since Lorelai and Rory no longer need her money for any tuition, that their routine Friday night dinners will end, so she proposes that she and Richard are willing to pay for some works of extension to do at the Dragonfly Inn as an excuse to keep frequenting her daughter. Lorelai is against this idea, but she learns to spend time with her mother and accepts to keep going to their usual Friday night dinners, implying that she will maintain a friendly relationship with her parents.

==Romantic relationships==
Besides an on-again, off-again relationship with Christopher, Lorelai's romantic relationships have included [[Alex Lesman]], an outdoorsy coffee house entrepreneur, [[Max Medina]], a teacher at Chilton who she almost wed, [[Jason Stiles]], and [[Luke Danes]], the owner of the local diner.

===Alex Lesman===
Alex is Lorelai's second boyfriend (not including Christopher) of the series and the least serious. Alex is a divorced dad of two and Lorelai and him find many things in common, including their mutual love for coffee. Lorelai meets Alex (played by Billy Burke) at a seminar in which Sookie reunites with a former friend. They go on a casual first date, in which they test coffees for Alex's up-and-coming coffee shop. They agree to go on a fishing date, although Lorelai has never fished. Lorelai enlists Luke Danes to teach her how to fish. Their entire relationship was more of a casual relationship than a meaningful one. The final time we see him in the series is the episode [[3.14]] in which he acquires 4 tickets to see the musical Levittown in New York. He invites Lorelai, Sookie and Jackson to join him. The musical is a bust but the four of them have a good time anyway. Alex is shown to be kind and considerate to Lorelai and her eccentricities. The moment when the two of them stop seeing each other is not portrayed in the series, but Lorelai kind of confides her cold feelings about her relationship with Alex to best friend Sookie.

===Jason Stiles===
Jason was Lorelai's third boyfriend of the series (not including Christopher). Jason and Lorelai know each other from childhood. Jason's father is one of Richard's partners and Lorelai and Jason both attended camp together. Jason pursues Lorelai and they begin a secret affair, partially fueled by the rebellious nature of the affair. Upon discovery by Richard and Emily, Lorelai continues to date Jason until dealings with Richard's company find Jason pitted against Richard. Lorelai refuses to support Jason's suit against her father and breaks up with him.

===Max Medina===
Max is Lorelai's first boyfriend (and fiancee) of the series, and one of the most serious. Max is a well-read teacher at Chilton to whom Lorelai is instantly attracted. Despite the forbidden nature (he is Rory's teacher), Lorelai agrees to date Max. Their relationship becomes serious over the course of the first season, and Max proposes to Lorelai twice. The first time was deemed romantically inadequate and he was refused; on his second try, he takes Lorelai's advice and sends her one thousand of her favorite flower, the yellow daisy (&quot;[[Love, Daisies and Troubadours]]&quot;). Lorelai accepts and their relationship continues until Lorelai's bachelorette party one week before the wedding, at which she realizes he is not &quot;the one&quot; and she can't marry him (&quot;[[Red Light on the Wedding Night]]&quot;). They run into each other two more times in [[Season 3]], in the episodes [[3.16]] and [[3.19]]. They share a kiss and reconcile feelings for one another. However, Max wants to move on and states that he never wants to see Lorelai again.

===Christopher Hayden===
Christopher was probably the most important man in Lorelai and [[Rory]]'s life throughout the series. Christopher and Lorelai met in childhood and were best friends. They began dating in their teenage years and Lorelai became pregnant at 16. Because he is Rory's father and comes from &quot;good breeding&quot;, Lorelai's parents approve of Christopher, and have continually pushed her to pursue a relationship with him. Despite several marriage proposals, Lorelai maintains a casual, friendly &quot;no-strings-attached&quot; affair with Christopher throughout the years. However, after discovering Christopher with a steady job and a Volvo (in place of the motorcycle he often appeared on in earlier years), Lorelai starts agreeing to the idea of settling down with Christopher. They almost become a serious couple in [[2.22]], however, the idea is crushed when Christopher finds out his girlfriend [[Sherry]] is pregnant. By the arrival of Christopher's new daughter [[Georgia Hayden|Georgia]], nicknamed Gigi, Lorelai is still trying to get over the failed relationship (again).

Lorelai decides to keep Christopher at arms length, but continues to come to his aid after Sherry leaves Christopher and Gigi to work in Paris. Christopher and Lorelai eventually rekindle their relationship following Lorelai's disengagement to Luke Danes. Christopher tells Lorelai he still loves her, has always loved her and would never stop loving her, and that he didn't want to spend the rest of his life without her. He is convinced that Lorelai is the one and finally convinces her to marry him in Paris, but a few of Lorelai's chance encounters with Luke are the catalyst to Christopher's jealousy and Lorelai's denial. The final straw in the relationship is in the form of a character reference Lorelai writes for Luke that Christopher discovers. Although Lorelai wishes to commit to Christopher and their marriage, she cannot keep lying to herself and to him. Lorelai confesses that not only does she still have strong feelings for Luke, but that Christopher is not 'the one' for her. They decide to divorce.

===Luke Danes===
Although Lorelai is perhaps Luke's Diner's best customer, Luke and Lorelai's relationship is platonic for many years. At first Luke is just &quot;the guy that pours her coffee&quot;. However, he is consistently there for her as a loyal friend and Rory's surrogate father, while admiring Lorelai from behind the counter. Lorelai and Luke's friendship goes way back to before the series began. When Lorelai and Rory first moved to Stars Hollow, Luke was one of the first people they met when Lorelai, frantic for coffee, harranged a busy Luke until he gave her some coffee. Luke is presumably attracted to Lorelai from their first encounter as it is discovered that he has kept a memento from their meeting years later; the hadn-written scorpio stating &quot;You will meet an annoying women today, give her coffee and she will go away&quot; that Lorelai gave to Luke eight years earlier is brought out and mentioned during their first date, and signifies Luke's commitment to their relationship.

Their relationship becomes serious towards the end of Season Four. The first step is taken by Luke after he listens to self-help tapes on how to love and recognize the woman you want. Lorelai is impressed by the change and both surprised and flattered. They date for a year before Lorelai, after losing contact with Rory over a major disagreement, is so deeply touched by Luke's dedication to her and Rory that she makes a wedding proposal to Luke. He accepts instantly and they begin expanding and renovating Lorelai's two-story home. The wedding date is postponed until Lorelai reunites with Rory. However, Lorelai senses hesitation in Luke when she begins planning the wedding. [[April Nardini]], Luke's secret source of hesitation, is a daughter that Luke unknowingly conceived in a previous relationship with Anna Nardini. Lorelai discovers that Luke has been hiding knowledge of April's existence (although he had tried to tell her but the moment never seemed right), and they eventually postpone the wedding again in order for Luke to be able to concentrate on building a relationship with his daughter.

Adding to Lorelai's doubts and fears over their relationship, Luke requests that Lorelai have no contact with April. Lorelai respects his wishes until he requests her aid in planning April's party. Unfortunately, Anna disapproves and adds to Lorelai's doubts over her and Luke's relationship. Lorelai eventually grows impatient and resentful towards Luke for making impossible demands of her and putting their lives of hold for so long. Having having avoided him for some time, she finally gives Luke an ultimatum—elope with her and get married now or never—to which Luke's inability to answer ends in Lorelai's departure, possibly from the relationship entirely. Lorelai, hurt and distraught, goes to Christopher for comfort and, after waking up in Christopher's bed, leaves the next morning looking guilty and disgusted with herself. Luke appears on her porch the same morning, his truck packed and with plans for their elopement and marriage. Lorelais is forced to tell Luke that she slept with Christopher last night. Luke says nothing but drives away.

At first, Lorelai and Luke remain somewhat detached but supportive after their break up. Lorelai avoids his diner and Luke until he asks Lorelai for help with April's appendicitus. At the hospital, Luke discovers that Lorelai has married Christopher. He later asks her for a character reference in order for him to win a custody battle with Anna over April. He comes to Lorelai's aid when Richard is in hospital and Christopher is missing in action. Eventually, after Lorelai's divorce from Christopher, they have a discussion about their relationship in the maze made of hay during the Stars Hollow spring break festival and both apologize for their mistakes. In the end, after coming through for her and Rory on many occasions - the most relevant being the one depicted in the finale where Luke organizes a big &quot;bon voyage party&quot; for Rory before she leaves Stars Hollow - Lorelai and Luke return to each other. Lorelai knows Luke is the one for her and that she can depend on him to always be there for her and Rory. In the final scene at the diner, Rory notices that Lorelai is wearing a necklace that she's never seen before. We learn that the necklace has just been given to her by Luke after a reuniting kiss in front of the diner. Rory remarks on the necklace and Lorelai, while saying she loves it, looks behind her to where Luke is standing. He later enters the frame and asks the Gilmore girls what they want from the menu. Lorelai tells him she needs to some time to think to which Luke responds, &quot;Take all the time you need&quot;. This becomes an obvious indication that she and Luke have spent some moments together off-screen discussing their future. Having learnt from their own experiences that being hasty brings nothing but trouble, the couple are reuinited and decide not to rush things.

==Trivia==
*Her favorite song in Junior High was Shadow Dancing.
*Her favorite band in high school was the Bangles. [[Concert Interruptus]]
*According to Season One DVD trivia book, Lorelai Gilmore is 5 feet 8 inches tall, but the actress portraying her, [[Lauren Graham]] is slightly taller than this at 5 feet 9 inches tall. Chelsea Brummet, who played the young Lorelai, is 5 feet 4 inches tall.
*Her feet are size nine.
*She is addicted coffee.
*Her favorite band in high school was The Go-Go's, but in season one, she cites Metallica as one of her favorite bands. Also high on that list would be The Bangles.
*She went through a ''Flashdance'' phase. [[The Deer Hunters]]
*She almost named Rory Susanna after her love of the Bangles. [[Concert Interruptus]]
*As a baby she had a big head. (&quot;My first complete sentence was 'Big Head want dolly.'&quot; — &quot;[[Emily In Wonderland (Episode 1.19)|Emily In Wonderland]]&quot;)
*She burnt all of her baby pictures because of her big head. However, at least one still remains, as evidenced when Rory found a picture of Lorelai after she had been baptized.
*She can smell snow before it falls; she had a special relationship with snow because many things happened during the snow (Rory born during a snow storm, Lorelai's first kiss, Rory's first steps, when Lorelai was a little girl and she was sick with an ear infection she wished that something wonderful would happen; the next morning snow fell and she was convinced that some fairy godmother sent it just for her.) Her relationship with snow falls apart, however, during season five when a bunch of problems occur because of it.
*A recurring joke in the first few seasons is Lorelai asking other people (usually Luke) if they have a pen. (&quot;Where's the pen you take orders with?&quot;)
*She wears glasses in [[Sadie, Sadie...]], [[Secrets and Loans]], [[The Fundamental Things Apply]] and [[We Got Us a Pippi Virgin!]]
*Throughout the series, Lorelai's political views seem to get along with Democrats. According to flashbacks in the episode &quot;[[Dear Emily and Richard]]&quot;, Lorelai claims she intends to register Democrat, mainly because it would go against her parents will; in a similar occasion, in the Season one episode where Chris and his parents show up at the Gilmore mansion after more than a decade, Lorelai makes one of her funny bits and declares she hates George W. Bush's face, to everyone's shock and dismay; in another episode in season 3, the episode intro has Lorelai making a funny bit with Rory where she says &quot;I think I'm in touch with the other side&quot; and Rory thinks she's speaking politically by giving the funny answer &quot;..With the Republicans?&quot;; in the final episode, Lorelai's daughter goes off into the world pursuing a career as an online reporter for Barack Obama's campaign, both women seem enthusiastic about this not only because it's Rory's first important job, but also because it fits their mutual views on politics.
*Lorelai, when asked by the Reverend about her religious affiliation, said that she and Rory had lapsed from religion despite their celebration of Christmas and Easter. However, she was raised as an Protestant - in episode &quot;How Many Kropogs to Cape Cod?&quot;, when Emily suggested that Lorelai will appear at friday night dinner only if they would have an important guest over, like the Pope, Lorelai replied: &quot;You're Protestant, Mom&quot;. When Lorelai was pregnant with Rory, her parents rejected Straub's idea of an abortion outright. For example, she did not want to accept a wedding gift after her break up from Max Medina for fear of Saint Peter showing it on a movie screen while her soul hung in the balance. Also, a phone call trying to return it incurred the wrath of a distant aunt, who claimed that having a child out of wedlock would send her to hell.
*Emily's dream wedding for Lorelai was a White Russian themed one. She would have had white roses and trees with white candles and arrived in a silver sleigh. When she asked Luke what he thought about the Romanovs, he answered &quot;They probably had it coming,&quot; to which she replied &quot;A match made in heaven.&quot;
*Kirk called her a &quot;pretty spinster.&quot;
*She doesn't like blood, as evidenced when she tried to clean Luke's cut that he got from fixing her window.
*She is slightly scared of Mrs. Kim.
*Lorelai would have gradated had her school allowed her to breastfeed Rory during the ceremony.
*Her dollhouse was given to her with the glass still on, and is considered by Sookie to be the only happy part of Lorelai's childhood.
*Her savings are never explicitly stated, though it can be assumed that it's less than the amount needed to pay for an upscale private school and university.
*Lorelai is closer to her father (or at least trusts him more) than her mother.
*She never wanted the &quot;country club&quot; life, yet she joined the Chilton booster club and ingratiated herself among the members, much to her mother's delight.
*Her baptismal dress was bought in London and had 12 petticoats; she ended up spilling grape juice on it, effectively ruining the dress.
*She owns 64 pairs of shoes.
*When her house had to be tented, she freaked out over the potential cost of $15,000. She had never had that much money, hence why she had her parents pay for Rory's education.
*There are at least three rules she created in the Gilmore survival guide: never run with scissors, get a pageboy cut, or have lunch alone with Emily Gilmore.
*She doesn't like avocado.
*She's not on speaking terms with Christopher's parents; before a horrendous Friday night dinner she hadn't seen them since she was 18 and Rory was two.
*Christopher is the only one who calls her &quot;Lor&quot;.

Several individual episodes seem to have 2 different articles each -- one linked through the main portal, and one linked through the &quot;categories&quot; page.  If there's no objection, I'll work on merging these articles.

'''Season one''' of ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', an American dramedy television series, began airing on October 5, 2000 on the WB television network. The season concluded on May 10, 2001, after 21 episodes.

The season was released on DVD as a six disc boxed set under the title of ''Gilmore Girls: The Complete First Season'' on May 4, 2004 by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.


==Plot==
A ''very'' atypical mother-daughter relationship is at the center of ''Gilmore Girls'', a comedy-drama that immediately set itself apart from the herd with smarter-than-smart dialogue and an endearing mix of whimsical comedy and family drama. Set in the Capra-esque burg of [[Stars Hollow]], where everybody knows everyone and eccentrics abound, ''Gilmore Girls'' was less a mother-daughter show and more of a screwball buddy comedy in which the two buddies happened to be parent and child. Pregnant at 16, [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] left her rich parents to bring up her daughter [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] on her own terms; when Rory herself turns 16, Lorelai wants to send her academically gifted daughter to the prestigious [[Chilton Preparatory School|Chilton]] school. The catch is, Lorelai can't afford it on her own, and rather than let Rory go without, the elder Gilmore girl brokers an uneasy truce with her parents, who finally get a chance to bond with their granddaughter while financing her education.

This is a first rough draft on how to contribute information to Gilmorepedia. Feel free to add/edit/correct. If you are not familiar with Wikis, please consider reading the Wiki help section in [[Help:Contents]] first.

==Adding core information==
Gilmorepedia is still much in need of basic information about the show, characters and episodes. Go ahead and add it, by following the portal links on the [[Main_Page|main page]], like [[Portal:Main_Characters|Main Characters]] or [[Portal:Episodes|Episodes]]. Have a look at the wiki-source of existing articles and try to match the basic style and structure.

==Filling in incompletes==

===Stubs===
[[:Category:Stubs]] contains a list of all pages marked as a &quot;Stub&quot;. A stub is an article that is incomplete and in need for expansion. If you would like to mark your new article as a stub, put a line like the following at the top: 
&lt;pre&gt;{{Stub}}&lt;/pre&gt;

===Wanted Pages===
[[Special:Wantedpages|Wanted pages]] on the other hand, is a list of articles waiting to be created, as they are linked by other articles, but are still devoid of content.

==Images==
You can upload images by using the [[Special:Upload]] link on the toolbox bar on the left. You can use images in article by using the image keyword:
&lt;pre&gt;[[image:myimage.jpg]]&lt;/pre&gt;

==Linking back==
You can add a link to the &quot;previous&quot; page using
&lt;pre&gt;{{BackLink|''whatever''}}&lt;/pre&gt; (without the ''commas'') i.e. [[Stars Hollow]]

==Templates==
Templates are a tool to simplify repeating wiki markups, like the information boxes in the character and episode articles. Currently, the following templates are implemented:

* [[Template:Infobox_character]] for character articles (like [[Lorelai Gilmore]])

* [[Template:Infobox_episode]] for episode articles (like [[1.01 - Pilot]])

* [[Template:Infobox_cast]] for articles about cast members (like [[Lauren Graham]])

Have a look at the example articles and their wiki source to find out how to use these templates, or follow the links given here for basic usage information.
&lt;br&gt;If you feel up to it, you are welcome to improve those templates or add new ones. Be mindful though that breaking a template can break the appearance of many articles that might depend on it. In which case don't panic, just roll back to a previous version :)</text>

==Summary==

Rory's first day at Chilton is stressful, as she meets a new rival, [[Paris Gellar]] ([[Liza Weil]]). [[Lorelai]] sleeps late and rushes to drop [[Rory]] off for her first day at Chilton. 

==Plot==
It's Rory's first day at the exclusive prep school Chilton, and Lorelai chooses this day to oversleep. This turns the morning into total chaos because she doesn't have time to pick up her dry cleaning, which means she has nothing to wear. Meanwhile Rory is ranting while Lorelai throws on some old rags in the form of a tight tie-dye shirt and some cutoffs jeans. In short, it looks like Lorelai is heading to the local rodeo.

Things go from bad to worse when Rory informs her frazzled mom that they both have to meet the headmaster at Chilton. Since Lorelai has nothing else to wear, she puts on an overcoat and walks out the door. On the way, Lorelai meets a man named Ian, who is the father of another Chilton student. The two get to know each other better and Lorelai tells Ian where she works in case he wants to drop by.

When Rory and Lorelai arrive at the headmaster's office, guess who is already there? Lorelai's mother, Emily, who just happens to be a close personal friend of the headmaster. Emily makes a big fuss when Lorelai refuses to shed her coat and then regrets her insistence when she gets a load of what Lorelai is wearing. Needless to say, the meeting is quick and awkward with Lorelai stuttering her way through.

Rory is now flying solo and gets a lousy initiation into the world of private school. Hanlon, the headmaster, does everything by the book and tells Rory that while she has a good academic record, her social activities are severely lacking. Now life as Rory knew it is over because she has enrolled a month late making it extremely hard to catch up.

Meanwhile some other Chilton students haven taken a peek at Rory's student file to get the lowdown on her. One of the girls, Paris, is already gearing up to make Rory's life a living hell.

Back in Stars Hollow, Lorelai makes it to the coffee shop and has to beg Luke for a cup of java, it's a jumbo coffee kind of morning, and then gets a little lecture from Luke on her inappropriate dress.

In class Rory gets a bitter taste of the Chilton academic standards, while Paris answers every single question about Tolstoy's favorite writers and major influences. But a cocky boy named Tristan makes his entrance and gives Rory the once over. At the end of class, Rory gets last week's assignments and the word &quot;daunting&quot; comes to mind. The day keeps getting worse as Paris makes it crystal clear that she is the best student at Chilton. Not only that, but she runs the school paper and will do whatever it takes to keep it that way. Before the next class, Tristan offers to &quot;lend his notes&quot; and he won't stop calling Rory &quot;Mary.&quot; What does that mean anyway?

Lorelai finally picks up her clean clothes from the dry cleaner and makes it to work, only to find Ian has arrived and wants to take her to dinner. She is flattered but declines because he is a Chilton dad and that is too close for comfort. As the day goes on, things are getting worse for Rory. She accidentally ruins Paris' homework project when she knocks Paris over as she tries to open her new locker. Paris is steamed and about to get a bad grade when Rory takes the blame and offers to help. Paris refuses, but the teacher forces Paris to take Rory's offer or she'll get a dreaded incomplete. Pair begins to feel threatened when Rory starts answering questions that are normally Paris' territory. Paris is on the border of a breakdown and vows to take revenge on Rory.

Before Lorelai goes to pick up Rory, she grabs another cup of coffee and tells Luke about her bad day and invitation from Ian. Luke says she did the right thing by declining.

When Lorelai finally picks up Rory from school, they do some major commiserating. Rory gets the truth about being called &quot;Mary.&quot; It's an old slang term for a &quot;goody-goody,&quot; originating from the Virgin Mary. Lorelai offers to help by talking to a teacher, but Rory says she'll handle it alone.

&quot;[[Gilmore Girls]]&quot; is an American tv series created by [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] and her husband [[Daniel Palladino]], starring [[Lauren Graham]] (Lorelai) and [[Alexis Bledel]] (Rory) as a mother and a daughter who are more friends than mother and daughter and who both dream of pursuing satisfaction in their love relationships and their careers. The show mixes the [[drama]] and [[comedy]] genres and presents a wide range of emotions, characters and situations. Although apparently the target audience seems the female genre, the series explores the male universe as well with the important characters of Luke ([[Scott Patterson]]), Jess ([[Milo Ventimiglia]]), Logan ([[Matt Czuchry]]), Christopher Hayden ([[David Sutcliffe]]), thus it has been appreciated also by male audiences.

The [[7.22|last episode]] of Gilmore Girls aired in the US on the 15th of May, 2007.

The series counts 7 produced seasons and a total of 153 aired episodes. Plus one unaired pilot where the characters of Sookie St. James and Dean Forester were played by different actors ([[Alex Borstein]], who later played the harp player Drella and the Gilmores fashion consultant Celine, and [[Nathan Wetherington]]).

Other main cast members are [[Kelly Bishop]] (Emily Gilmore), [[Edward Herrmann]] (Richard Gilmore), [[Keiko Agena]] (Lane), [[Liza Weil]] (Paris), [[Melissa McCarthy]] (Sookie), [[Yanic Truesdale]] (Michel), [[Jared Padalecki]] (Dean), [[Emily Kuroda]] (Mrs. Kim), [[Sean Gunn]] (Kirk), [[Sally Struthers]] (Babette), [[Liz Torres]] (Miss Patty), [[Michael Winters]] (Taylor Doose), [[Todd Lowe]] (Zach), Matt Czuchry (Logan Huntzberger) [[Adam Brody]] (Dave Rygalski) and [[Sebastian Bach]] (Gil).

From season 1 to season 4 the show was shot and presented in the traditional [[TV format]], while season 5, 6 and 7 were shot and aired in a [[Widescreen]] format. Except the pilot episode and a few other episodes in season 1, which were partly shot on location in Canada, the whole series was shot in Hollywood on set. The hills that can be seen in the background from time to time are nothing but those of [[Mount Hollywood]].

The show used an overall homogeneous, real world, naturalistic [[visual style]], although the later seasons have gotten darker and more theatrical - more rich also in set elements and decorations, especially in the Gilmore Mansion, to go with the larger scale format -, in season 6 and 7, the slightly different color palettes and the lighting mirrored the change of the series tones: Lorelai's house got redecorated and expanded, thus it showed a different kind of lighting, accompanied by brighter and more feminine tints. The overall look and feel though was definitely not so bright, as Lorelai and Rory's lives... This was stressed by emotional, dramatic scenes characterized by darker and gloomier lights and colors. Following creator Amy Sherman-Palladino's directives for the DVD release of the series, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; was published in the traditional [[4:3]] TV format - the 1.33: 1 aspect ratio - completely from season 1 to 7, also cutting on the use of the modern [[5.1 surround]] audio format.

Pop and cultural references to go with a speedy exchange of witty, sometimes incomprehensible dialogues between every character, are what makes the style of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; unique though. Another feature that characterizes the style of the series is a specific taste for the old and retro in general: from TV shows, movies to music, from costumes and set decorations, there is a choice in things that don't exactly look like the world of today and the world the other comedy TV series usually depict.

We know that the Palladinos made a homage, with the quick dialogues everyone have, to the whole [[classic movie genre]] made of black and white pictures where actors engaged in super-speedy conversations (a direct homage is depicted in the episode [http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/Say_Something 5.14 Say something], but also visual gags recalling [[screwball comedies]] back from the 30s or even before (for instance, we unexpectedly learn that Rory has a thing for the old movies of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx_Brothers Marx Brothers]; she organizes a Marx marathon with her friend Marty in a season 5 episode).

We know that Lorelai likes the 80s movies (she shows some new millennium kids an old John Hughes movie with Molly Ringwald, &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, in the episode [[6.20 Super Cool Party People]] and references many times the cult &quot;Breakfast Club&quot;, by the same director) as much as those dreamy musicals from the 50s-60s (as in [[7.04 'S Wonderful, 'S Marvelous]] where &quot;Funny Face&quot;, starring Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire, is the movie Christopher screens privately for Lorelai on a farm's wall their first date together since High school).

[[Image:7-10.png|thumb|left|255px|Luke Danes and Christopher Hayden come to terms in their rivalry in the episode &quot;[[7.10 Merry Fisticuffs]]&quot;]]

The emblematic Luke-Lorelai-Chris triangle of the series is also subtly mirrored in the final scene of episode [[7.08 Introducing Lorelai Planetarium]] with the introduction of a sequence from the movie &quot;[[The Philadelphia Story]]&quot; which Luke watches on the hospital TV soon after he discovered Lorelai's instant marriage with Christopher, an event that contrasts his original plans, made at the 7th season's beginnings, to marry Lorelai while taking a flight to Maryland - which is a situation depicted similarly also in the above mentioned [[George Cukor]] film, also starring [[Katherine Hepburn]], an actress [[Lauren Graham]] has often been compared to by critics and fans.

In contradiction to that old-vibe, from season 4 till the end, the distance between Lorelai and Rory caused by Rory's life in college and at her boyfriend's apartment has determined also a very modern style depicted through mobile and non-mobile [[phone-dialogue scenes]] between mother and daughter that have kept the bizarre and witty style they had when they still lived together and talked live. An over-the-top use of phones was shown in episodes where the characters kept driving their cars or other vehicles (like a bicycle in episode [[7.19 It's Just Like Riding a Bike]]) while calling each other, or when more than two (sometimes also four) characters entertained a conversation on the phone, with obvious comical results.

The seventh season's production was taken by [[David S. Rosenthal]], who had already worked on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; the previous season with the original creators, the Palladinos, who left the production officially for differences with the CW network at the end of season six over issues about whether renewing their contracts or not. Off the record, it was said that the relationship between the Palladinos and Rosenthal was optimal on the sets. Rosenthal was also a writer previously in the series and he definitely was the best person who could replace the Palladinos. Although the production didn't mention anything about continuing the work on the series while the last episodes were being produced because it was almost sure they would have come back after the summer for a new season, the narrative arcs of the series during its last season were fully explored and the more the final episode was coming near, the more the writers and producers, including Lauren Graham who portrayed the character of Lorelai, felt the need to give the series a sense of closure no matter what.

The actual reasons behind the failure in the negotiations between the [[Warner Bros.]] production company, the [[CW network]], the series producers and the series star names to produce an eighth further season of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; are many - the main was a money and salary issue -, all of them kind of surrounded by an aura of mystery. Thus, up until shortly before the produced series finale, it was unclear to many if the show would get another season. This fact had a great impact mainly on the fans but also the cast, who were kind of taken aback when they learned that they weren't gonna go back to working in the series by the end of the summer. Many fans, who were enraged by the unannounced cancellation, saw this [[finale]] as unsatisfying and - in worst cases - incomplete. Actually, all of this is the result of a particular feature that characterizes the episode final scenes and, for that matter, the whole series: the imaginativeness. Most people were left puzzled by it because the way the whole final sequence of season seven was written and directed leaves a major detail - Lorelai and Luke's future wedding plans - up to the audience's ability of interpretation (read the &quot;Lorelai Gilmore's character profile&quot; to have an insight on this matter).

==Plot Outline==
Lorelai Gilmore, 32, has such a close relationship with her daughter [[Rory]] that they are often mistaken for sisters. Between Lorelai's relationship with her parents, Rory's new [[Chilton|prep school]], and both of their romantic entanglements, there's plenty of drama to go around.

}}
Lorelai Victoria Gilmore was born to [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] and [[Richard Gilmore]] in  Hartford, Connecticut. Her life growing up was complicated due to an overbearing, neurotic mother and a workaholic father, who both expected far too much from Lorelai.

As a child, Lorelai met [[Christopher Hayden]]. In high school, they began dating after she walked up to him and kissed him. At the age of 15, Lorelai found out she was pregnant and the world between them came crashing down. Both Lorelai and Christopher's parents were unhappy with the pregnancy. Christopher's parents expressed their concerns and suggested that Lorelai abort the unborn child. Lorelai's parents thought it best for her and Lorelai to marry, while Christopher would work for Richard's company. Lorelai refused to marry Christopher.

On an October evening in 1984, Lorelai was at home alone and went into labour. She left a note addressed to her parents and then headed to the hospital. Emily and Richard arrived at the hospital just as Lorelai was being moved to delivery. After an agonizing delivery, Lorelai Leigh Gilmore was born. Christopher proposed marriage to Lorelai but she refused.

About a year later, Lorelai packed up herself and baby [[Rory]] and left home. She ended up in nearby [[Stars Hollow]], where she met [[Mia]], who offered Lorelai a job and a place to stay. Lorelai took a job at the [[Independence Inn]], Mia's business, as a maid. She and Rory lived in a gardening shed on the inn grounds.

Years go by, Rory grows up and Lorelai has continued to stay in the inn business, working her way up to manager. There she meets [[Michel Gerard|Michel]], the sarcastic concierge and chef [[Sookie St. James|Sookie]]. The three share an odd, but loving relationship and grow closer as the years go on. Sookie and Lorelai's friendship has become a very intensely devoted relationship.

Lorelai also creates a strong bond with another local resident, [[Luke Danes]]. He is the owner of the town's local diner, [[Luke's Diner]]. Their relationship is fun and extremely solid. Luke would do just about anything to help out Lorelai and Rory and vice versa. Some people in the town believe Luke and Lorelai are meant to be together but neither seem to want to ruin their relationship with romance or maybe the oppurtunity just hasn't arisen yet. Either way, Luke is a constant fixture in Lorelai and Rory's lives as they meet almost every morning at his diner for breakfast.

As Rory grows up, Lorelai sees how intelligent her daughter is. Lorelai is thrilled to find out that Rory has been accepted to the prestigious prep school, [[Chilton]]. However, there is one small problem. Lorelai cannot fund this educational venture on her own. She swallows her pride and resorts to returning to Emily and Richard for a favour. Lorelai's parents agree to pay their granddaughter's tuition on one condition: Both Lorelai and Rory must attend Friday night dinners every week. Lorelai reluctantly agrees and a tiny sliver of hope for a relationship with her parents begins.

Eventually, through Rory, Lorelai meets [[Max Medina]], an English professor at Chilton High. They begin to date and things start to heat up between them. After a few months of dating, Max proposes to Lorelai first in the heat of the moment after a fight which Lorelai refuses and then second after he realizes he can't live without her. Everything was set for the big day and all was going according to plan but Lorelai had a change of heart. She woke Rory during the early morning hours and suggested they take a road trip. Rory, confused, asked what was wrong and Lorelai replied that the wedding was off.

During the time of Sookie's wedding, Christopher returns, and he and Lorelai briefly get together, and plan to try to live as a family, with Rory. However, it does not last because Sherry, Christopher's girlfriend - with whom he had hit a rough patch, and was thinking of breaking up - announces that she is pregnant. Not wanting to ruin his relationship with his unborn child as he did with Rory, Christopher returns to Sherry. Lorelai is heartbroken and Rory is very upset with her father for hurting her and her mother a second time.

A few months later, when Mia visits Stars Hollow, Lorelai mentions that she and Sookie had been thinking about opening their own Inn.  Mia replies that the timing is perfect, as she is thinking of selling the Independence Inn.  Lorelai is greatly troubled by this, as the Independance Inn was where she and Rory lived for many years when they first came to Stars Hollow, it is where Rory grew up and took her first steps.  Consequently, Lorelai and Sookie temporarily abandon their project - but soon get back on track.  The girls find the Inn of their dreams - the old Dragonfly Inn.  However the current owner, Fran, is not interested in selling. In 2003, Fran, unfortunately passes on and her next of kin agrees to sell the Dragonfly Inn to Lorelai and Sookie. Lorelai and Sookie jump at the chance of a lifetime and the deal goes through. Lorelai, Sookie and Michel then take on the task of restoring the Inn so it can be as lively as it once was.

Lorelai's father, during this time, decided to quit his job and go into business for himself. He brings along the son of his former employer and together they create a large investment firm. [[Jason Stiles|Jason &quot;Digger&quot; Stiles]], the son of the former employer, at first is not one of Lorelai's favorite people but soon the two become smitten with each other and begin dating. They both decide to keep this from their parents but after some time, the secret becomes known and Richard takes out his disappoinment on Jason by returning to his old job and leaving Jason in the dust. Lorelai is furious with her father and tries to get him to reconsider but to no avail. She then learns that Jason has decided to sue her father for damages and that throws her for a loop. She tells him she can not date someone suing a member of her family and they break up.

After some time, Lorelai, Sookie and Michel decide that they need to do a test run on their new Inn. Just to work out any kinks in the service before the big opening day. During the test run of the Inn, Lorelai asks for Rory's help in creating a memorable evening for various guests from around town such as Luke, [[Miss Patty]], [[Taylor Doose|Taylor]], [[Kirk Gleason|Kirk]] and his girlfriend Lulu, Emily and Richard, and [[Babette Dell|Babette]]. Unfortunately, the beginnings of a romantic relationship between Luke and Lorelai almost come to a halt, when Jason, Richard's ex-business partner and Lorelai's ex-boyfriend shows up to express his love for Lorelai. But Luke and Lorelai are able to work it out and finally share their first kiss. However, her excitement to share the news with Rory turns into disappointment when she goes to their house and realizes that Rory and her ex-boyfriend [[Dean Forester|Dean]], whom is now married, have had sex. Lorelai and Rory get into a fight over the fact that Rory is now the other woman in Dean's life and that she helped him cheat on his wife. Rory is very upset and leaves, only to realize her mom is right.

Lorelai's relationship with Luke quickly becomes serious - she even brings him home to meet her parents!  However, Emily does not think that Luke is good enough for Lorelai, so she goes to Christopher - who has since broken up with Sherry - and tells him that he should try his luck with Lorelai, because they are 'meant to be together'.  When Lorelai and Luke go to Emily and Richard's vow renewal, they find that Christopher is also attending.  There, Christopher declares his undying love to Lorelai, stating that 'everyone knows we are meant for each other'.  Luke leaves in a fury - telling Lorelai that he needs time to think.  Over the next few days, Lorelai persistantly tries to talk to him, and he finally snaps - saying that if she can't accept that he needs time, then they should break up.  Lorelai is miserable, and we soon see that Luke is as well - and Lorelai stops going to Friday night dinners, furious about Emily's involvement.  Finally, Emily goes to see Luke, and tells him that Lorelai really loves him and that they should get back together.  Luke goes to Lorelai's house, they kiss, and make up.  At the end of the 5th season, Loreali proposes to Luke, and he accepts.

==Summary==
[[Rory]] takes up golf to fulfill a school athletic requirement and, to [[Lorelai]]'s dismay, grows fond of her grandfather when he takes her to his country club for a day on the links. The inn staff prepares for a double wedding involving sets of identical twins. 

==Plot==
It's the weekly Friday-night dinner with the grandparents and Lorelai is totally disgusted with her parents' attitude toward their household help. Richard and Emily don't even know the name of their own maid, which just widens the great divide between them and Lorelai. The conversation turns to Rory and when it is revealed that she needs to pick a sport to play for Chilton, Emily decides that Richard should take Rory to the country club and give her golf lessons. Lorelai freaks out, but Emily accuses her of being afraid of letting Rory go because she might have a good time without Lorelai. And that is exactly what Lorelai is scared of.

Rory is headed to the country club and Lorelai is beside herself. When the big day arrives, Lorelai is busy planning a wedding at the Independence Inn for a set of spoiled rich twin girls. Lorelai says she has everything under control, but all she can do is worry about Rory. She keeps awaiting &quot;save me&quot; phone call, but it never does.

Meanwhile, Rory and Richard hit the green, but Richard isn't looking all that thrilled. Things go from bad to worse when Rory takes her first swing and takes a big chunk out of the grass. As for Lorelai, she is looking for sympathy from Sooki and is making a big deal out of Rory's day. Clearly, Lorelai believes her daughter will have a miserable time.

Back at the club, Rory and Richard are warming up to each other. It helps that Rory actually hit the ball, even thought it did go into the water. Rory asks her grandfather what he does for a living and the two begin to bond even more. With his job, Richard gets to travel, which is something Rory really wants to do. When Rory graduates from high school, her and Lorelai are going to go backpacking through Europe. Richard thinks that is a fabulous idea and is enjoying himself so much that he invites Rory to have lunch.

That night, Rory and Lorelai meet up at the local diner. Lorelai wants to know all about her daughter's golfing adventure, but Rory's answers do not exactly sit well with mom. In other words, Lorelai just can't deal with the fact that Rory had a good time with her grandfather. This leaves Lorelai feeling a bit jealous.

When Richard calls for Rory the next day, Lorelai can hardly contain her envy. She watches her daughter on the phone and realizes her daughter's getting something that she never got from her own dad. Turns out, Richard just called to tell Rory he found a book they were talking about. The next thing you know, Lorelai's picking a stupid fight, making Rory realize her mom's jealousy.

Lorelai knows she is being totally irrational but can't help it. Sookie points out that she is jealous because her own parents like Rory better than Lorelai. Ultimately, Lorelai ran away from her privileged life and it never occurred to her that Rory might want it. If the country club life is what Rory wants, then what can she do?

The twin wedding goes off without a hitch and Lorelai tries to make peace with Rory. In the end, she admits that it was hard to see Rory bond with her grandparents.

'''The Deer Hunters''' is the fourth episode in season one of Gilmore Girls. 

==Summary==
After receiving a &quot;D&quot; in English, [[Rory]] crams for an upcoming Shakespeare test. After a late night of studying, followed by a mishap en route to Chilton, Rory misses the test with disastrous consequences. 

==Plot ==
It is amazing how a bad mark at school, can change the course of a week. Rory finds this out when she receives a &quot;D&quot; on an assignment. To make things worse, a huge Shakespearian test is announced and Pairs starts to gloat about her perfect grade.

Back at the Independence Inn, things are not going any better. A critic recently published a review of the inn's food and it stated that Sookie's Risotto was just &quot;fine&quot;. This immediately depresses Sookie and she initiates a search to find out who the critic was so she can remedy the Risotto.

Meanwhile, Lorelai arrives at a parent-teacher interview and finds out about Rory's bad grade. Shocked, she leaves to find and comfort Rory. Together, the two girls spend the rest of the week studying for the big Shakespearian test.

Finally the test day is here and they both have over slept. A &quot;Gilmore panic&quot; arises and Rory runs out the door with the keys to Lorelai's jeep. On her way to Chilton, a deer hits the car (not the car hits the deer) and Rory becomes even more flustered. This delay causes her to walk into class late and results in her being told she cannot take the test. Rory doesn't think that is fair at all and creates such a fuss she is sent to the headmaster's office and her mom is called. With the mother and daughter pair being so much a like, Lorelai too agrees that it is unfair Rory isn't allowed to take the test. She then reenacts Rory's earlier &quot;tantrum&quot; giving the headmaster a good idea of what it is like to mess with a Gilmore.

On their way home, Rory insists that they stop and look for the deer. While they walk, Lorelai tries to encourage Rory and tell her that she will be able to make it at Chilton. Once they are done looking for the deer, the two bond and head for home.

==Summary==
[[Rory]] discovers [[Lorelai]] and [[Max]] 's budding relationship. Cinnamon, the cat of the Gilmores' next door neighbor [[Babette]], passes away. The town comes together to throw a wake. Rory and [[Dean]] make progress in their own budding relationship. 

==Plot ==
During the regular Friday night dinner, Lorelai finds out her cousin died, but she has no idea who the person was, so going to the funeral is out of the question. The usual bickering ensues because Emily finds this unacceptable, while Rory watches in amusement.

Meanwhile, Chilton is having its annual bake sale and Rory is nervous because the food needs to be homemade. Lorelai assures her daughter that all is okay; she has it covered, even though there is no baking going on.

As Rory waits for her bus to take her to Chilton, Dean comes sauntering by and spots her. He jumps on the bus to chat and Rory is a bit unprepared but super psyched. He is flirting with her and she does not know what to do. After a few awkward moments he gets off at his stop and Rory continues on her way. The Chilton bake sale is filled with desserts and pastries of all kinds. Luckily, Lorelai brings Sookie, a chef from the Independence Inn, who has prepared a sweet feast that would befit any king. Max Medina, the teacher Lorelai is having a flirting fling with, comes by and asks for some private time. He wants to make peace over the test incident with Rory and eventually asks Lorelai on a date. But Lorelai is quick to point out that if he is such a rule follower, how come he is ready to date the mother of a student?

Ultimately, Lorelai just cannot do it. She finds it to be a bit weird and even a little wrong. But Max is persistent and brings down the offer to just a having coffee date. A harmless, decaf-coffee date. She agrees but in a noncommittal, I-just-happen-to-have-coffee-at-this-place-at-this-time sort of thing.

After school, Rory spots Dean at the local store where he works and decides to go in spontaneously. She pretends to buy some stuff but when Dean spots her, she gets really nervous and hides. She grabs some random produce and heads for the checkout line. He tries to bag her goods, but she bails.

Lorelai on the other hand is much more suave with the opposite sex. Her coffee date is full of witty banter until Max asks if they going to be able to date or not? Lorelai says she would never under any circumstances hurt her daughter, but Max has a few wise words of his own &quot;If there's something in your gut that you know is right, you've got to go after it, no matter what,&quot; says Max. He turns out to be quite persuasive and Lorelai agrees to have dinner.

The night of Lorelai's date is a night of a little chaos and lots of mourning. The neighbor's beloved cat dies so Rory and Lorelai must put together an impromptu wake, one that the whole town seems to attend. Even Dean shows up with sodas from the store. When Max shows up for, Lorelai has an awkward situation on her hands. She totally forgot about their date and also forgot to tell Rory she would be dating her teacher. Rory is not at all pleased and either is Max when he finds out he has been dumped because of a cat. Max is about to give up on the two ever dating, but Lorelai promises, &quot;Cross my heart and hope no other neighborhood pets die on that day.&quot;

Meanwhile, Dean finds Rory and says he thought she was interested in him but obviously she isn't, so he is going to scram. He turns to go, but Rory stops him and tells him that she is indeed interested. Then in true Rory fashion, she bolts leaving Dean with a big fat smile on his face.

Lorelai finally talks to Rory about Max and comes clean. When she asks Rory what she thinks of her mother dating one of her teachers, Rory says she is not saying Lorelai cannot date him, but it is totally weird. In the end they come to an understanding, just as long as Lorelai tells the truth from now on and does not keep anything else from Rory that affects her life, it is a done deal.

When they get home that night, Emily calls and Lorelai makes a big mistake when she tells her mom about the cat funeral they just attended. Rory tried to stop Lorelai but it is too late. Emily does not understand why Lorelai could not make it to her own cousin's funeral, but she is gone all day because of a cat.

'''Lorelai Leigh &quot;Rory&quot; Gilmore''' is played by [[Kimberly Alexis Bledel|Alexis Bledel]]. She is the daughter of [[Lorelai Gilmore]] and [[Christopher Hayden]].

==Early History==
Lorelai &quot;Rory&quot; Leigh Gilmore is the only daughter of [[Lorelai Gilmore]] and the first born daughter of [[Christopher Hayden]]. She was born on October 8th, 1984, at 4:03 a.m. Rory shares her mother's taste for many of the same things, such as junk food, coffee, movies, and music. However, as stated by her father Christopher, both he and Rory have similar left ear lobes. Though born in Hartford, Connecticut, Lorelai raised Rory in [[Stars Hollow]] where her mother originally worked as a maid at the [[Independence Inn]]. Rory didn't have much contact with her grandparents, [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[Emily Gilmore]], until she started [[Chilton]].

==School Years==
===Stars Hollow High School===
Rory spent her first year of high school attending [[Stars Hollow High School]]. She found out that she had been accepted to [[Chilton]] and shortly after transferred there.

Rory never stopped loving SHH and she also wanted to attend the prom with [http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/Jess_Mariano Jess] rather than going to the Chilton prom, because she always had a deeper connection to this school than to Chilton because she is from Stars Hollow.

===Chilton===
[[File:Gilmore-girls-season-1-rory.jpg|thumb|left|Rory's Chilton uniform]]

Rory attended the prestigious Chilton Prep for her sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school. To pay tuition, Lorelai asked her estranged parents for help. They agreed to pay on one condition: for Lorelai and Rory to come to their house every Friday night for dinner, at 7:00 sharp. This tradition continued after graduation as Richard and Emily agreed to pay for Rory's college tuition as well (and even continued after her financial obligation to them had ended). The school was run by [[Headmaster Charleston]] who informed Rory on her first day that she was likely to fail at Chilton and that the Gilmore name would earn her no favours.

Rory had a rocky start at Chilton, receiving her first D on a paper in [[Max Medina]]'s class. Mr. Medina, Rory's English professor, took a special interest in Rory and even dated (and became engaged to) Lorelai for the majority of the [[Season 1|first season]]. After receiving the D,[[File:Gilmore-girls-season-3-16.jpg|thumb|right|Rory's graduation speech]]

Rory spent hours studying for a Shakespeare exam for which she was late, due to the fact that a deer hit her car, and was not allowed to take &lt;small&gt;([[The Deer Hunters]])&lt;/small&gt;.
After this, Rory learned to cope with the demands of Chilton. She finished her first year in the top 3% of her class and went on to graduate as Valedictorian.

While at Chilton, Rory met many people; [[Paris Gellar|Paris]], [[Madeline Lynn|Madeline]], [[Louise Grant|Louise]], and [[Tristan DuGrey|Tristan]] - who has a crush on her in her first year at Chilton - to name a few.

===Yale===
At the beginning of the series, Rory was on the track to attending [[Harvard]] but when the time for decision came [[Yale]] turned out to be the better choice. In the [[Season 4|4th season]] Rory began , but took a semester off in her junior year([[Season 5]] &amp;[[Season 6| Season 6]]) when [[Mitchum Huntzberger]], the father of her boyfriend,[http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/Logan_Huntzberger Logan Huntzberger] , told her she did not have what it took to be a journalist. Lorelai tried to get Emily and Richard to help her talk Rory out of dropping out of Yale, but they turned on her by offering Rory a place to live instead. During this semester off, Rory and her mother did not speak, as Lorelai knew that Rory was making a big mistake. However, she returned to Yale for the spring semester, joyously reunited with Lorelai, and graduated the following year.

[[File:Gilmore-girls52.jpg|thumb|left|288px|Rory's graduation]]
After graduation, she took a job following the Obama campaign for an online magazine, and in the series finale she leaves for Iowa.

==Relationships==
===[[Dean Forester]]===
Before leaving [[Stars Hollow High School]], Rory met fellow schoolmate; her first boyfriend, [[Dean Forester]]. Dean gave Rory her first kiss in the episode [[Kiss and Tell]] in [[Doose's Market]], where Dean worked for most of the series. Rory and Dean dated for most of season 1 until the episode [[Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers]] when Dean revealed that he's built Rory a car for their anniversary, and told her that he loved her. Rory reacts badly to this, stating that she needs time and this is a big step for her to take. The following episode, [[The Breakup, Part 2]], Rory revealed that Dean broke up with her because she didn't tell him she loved him, too. This break, however, doesn't last long, in the final episode [[Love, Daisies and Troubadours (Episode 1.21)|Love, Daisies and Troubadours]] Rory drops significant hints (like at the town meeting) that she misses Dean and really does love him, resulting him turning up at Chilton where Rory tells him that she loves him (&quot;Dean!&quot; &quot;What?!&quot; &quot;Stop!&quot; &quot;Why?!&quot; &quot;Because I love you, you idiot!&quot;) and they get back together. They dated for all of season 2 but broke up in season 3 in the episode &quot;[[They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?]]&quot; because Rory had developed feelings for bad boy [[Jess Mariano]]. Rory later expressed regret about the relationship with Jess to her best friend [[Lane Kim]]; saying that, while she was initially attracted to Jess' intellectualism and his &quot;bad boy nature,&quot; she had become used to Dean's reliability and affectionate nature. She expected Jess to treat her the same way, but she realizes he never would.

Dean later starts dating a girl named [[Lindsay Lister]]. However, it is still obvious that he carries strong feelings for Rory. His attraction to her remains so strong that, at a party, when he discovers that Jess made her cry, he violently attacks Jess, resulting in a brawl between the two (in the end, Dean threw both the first and last punches of the fight). At his bachelor party on the night before his wedding to Lindsay, Dean expresses to Luke in his drunken state - that he feels Rory is the only girl he can marry, later forgetting the statement.

[[File:Foto-promo-di-rory-e-dean-alexis-bledel-e-jared-padalecki-per-la-serie-una-mamma-per-amica-116907.jpg|thumb|254px|Rory &amp; Dean]]Dean remains close to Rory and, when it becomes clear to him that he's made a mistake in marrying Lindsay, who has forbidden him to see or talk to Rory after she overheard Rory badmouthing her to [[Lane Kim|Lane]] in Doose's Market, he goes to Rory and they start an affair — Rory's first sexual experience. Lindsay eventually finds out about the affair when she finds a letter that Rory wrote to Dean about the whole experience in his jacket pocket, and angrily throws Dean out, which briefly complicates things with Rory. Dean decides to rekindle his romance with Rory (even though she now lives at Yale), much to the aggravation of many, including Luke and Rory's Grandparents, all of whom judge Dean unworthy of Rory. To make matters worse, Dean and Rory find their lives heading in completely different directions. With Rory rarely in Stars Hallow due to her life at Yale and Dean holding three jobs at once to make ends meet, the two of them rarely find time to spend together; both cancel date after date due to their commitments.The two finally find time for a date; it was planned that Dean would pick Rory up after a party that her grandparents planned to throw for her. However, the party was thrown with the sole purpose of introducing Rory to other prospective blue blooded boyfriends with business aspirations, including Rory's next boyfriend, Logan Huntzberger. Rory enjoys herself at the party so much that she briefly forgets about her planned outing. She eventually remembers, and by the time she walks out to Dean, the two realize that their lives were heading in different directions, and Dean ends their relationship for good.In his final appearance in &quot;To Live And Let Diorama&quot;, Dean does not see Rory, but rather Luke. Dean relates his faulty relationship with Rory to Luke's with Lorelai, saying that ultimately, Luke would hold Lorelai back from whatever potential she may have. With this statement, Dean is never heard from again.

===[[Jess Mariano]]===
Jess's mother, Liz, sent Jess away to Stars Hollow, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut Connecticut] to live with her brother, [[Luke Danes]] because she couldn't handle him and thought that Luke could. But Jess's arrival in Stars Hollow wasn't well received by the town at large. Luke has an even bigger problem controlling Jess's personal life while he's in Stars Hollow. Despite his actions, Jess's knowledge of books and pop culture eventually appeal to Rory Gilmore. They become friends despite others' disapproval, and Jess pursues Rory, despite her relationship with Dean. Jess leaves town for a while following a car accident which leaves Rory injured. Rory skips school to visit him in New York, where they officially say goodbye. Jess and Rory officially start dating after the local dance marathon when Dean tells Rory he knows she is interested in Jess and breaks up with her. Their relationship runs into trouble because of both Jess's and Rory's constant insecurities and difficulties communicating. Rory later confesses to her friend Lane Kim that, while she was initially attracted to Jess due to their similar interests, she was ultimately too used to Dean's affection and reliability, expecting Jess to treat her the same, only to realize that he never would. When Luke finds out that Jess would not be allowed to graduate from Stars Hollow High because he had cut too many classes, he tells Jess that he must repeat his senior year or leave. Unwilling to accept Luke's stipulations, Jess goes to Calfornia to live with his father. [[File:Big_alexis_bledel_milo_ventimiglia_una_mamma_per_amica.jpg|thumb|284px|Rory &amp; Jess]]Jess briefly returns to Stars Hollow in season four to steal back his car from Luke after his mom tells him Luke stole it from him nearly a year earlier. Jess also sees Rory several times, though every encounter ends with him giving her the cold shoulder. Jess leaves after telling her that he loves her. A few months later, Jess returns to Stars Hollow for his mother Liz's wedding. After the wedding, Jess visits Rory at Yale and asks her to run away with him. She declines. Two years later, a much more mature Jess returns to deliver a copy of the book he has written to Rory, explaining his new life working at an independent publishing company, and explaining that he could not have achieved any of his recent success had she not believed in him when they were teenagers. At the time, Rory had dropped out of Yale and moved into her grandparents' house. They decide to get something to eat, but are interrupted by an agitated Logan, who invites himself along. During the reunion, Logan treats Jess ironically in the same way Jess's has teased Dean in the past; he is condescending and arrogant. Jess walks out amid an argument with Logan. Although Rory goes after him, Jess refuses to stay. He is shocked that Rory is dating someone like Logan, and more importantly that she has dropped out of school with no plans for the future, and repeatedly demands to know what's going on, telling her &quot;this isn't you, Rory, you know it isn't.&quot; His criticism and refusal to accept excuses make Rory take a serious look at her life and are instrumental in her return to Yale. He then says this is a bad time for them to meet up, so he'll see her another time. Jess appeared for the final time in the Season 6 episode &quot;The Real Paul Anka&quot;, where he, Luke and Rory meet again at the new book store/art gallery/publishing house in Philadelphia where Jess works. Rory and Jess exchange a kiss, but Rory tells Jess that she is still in love with Logan and only did it because she found out Logan had been with someone else while they were broken up. Jess is hurt at being used, but says that she can tell Logan something happened. After that he is never mentioned again.

===[[Logan Huntzberger]]===
Logan and Rory first meet when Logan and his friends pass by Rory and her friend Marty and Logan and his friends tease Marty and pay little attention to Rory. However, when Logan meets Rory for the first time in the hall he is captivated by her debate skills when she gives him a good lecture about how he treated Marty. Logan continues to debate with her and promises that he will always remember Rory. Rory at first thinks Logan is just a lazy rich boy, the kind of boy Lorelai has warned her about. However, slowly she changes her mind when she needs help on a article of a secret society that Logan is in called the Life and Death Brigade, she is fascinated by the club and is convinced to take a dangerous jump with Logan causing Rory to look at Logan in a new light. Logan also comforts Rory at a party after she and Dean break up. Rory soon has a crush on Logan, and while Logan admits he likes her as well he says he is not a commitment guy so they agree to a no strings relationship. During that relationship there are signs that they both want more like when Logan is jealous of Rory dating his friend Robert, Rory eventually decides the relationship is too much for her so she tries to end it.

[[File:F9b37dffc1_7274305_o2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Rory &amp; Logan]]However, Logan, not wanting to lose Rory and caring about her more than any other girl, agrees to a monogamous relationship. Despite the disapproval of his family and Rory dropping out of Yale, their relationship is stable until a break up in S6, though Rory doesn't think of it as a break up.

Logan was threatened by the arrival of Jess in Season 6, even more so when he found out that Jess and Rory had been &quot;high school sweethearts&quot;, and acted a little bit like Jess in comparison to Dean. After Rory argued with Logan about his behavior towards Jess and the aimlessness of their life together, they decided to &quot;take a break&quot;. However, Logan saw this as a break up and proceeded to sleep with his older sister's friends for comfort.

Logan is also known for making grand and romantic gestures (usually as an apology), such as purchasing a coffee cart and barista for Rory's own personal use. Rory loved the gifts but didn't give in until Logan swallowed his pride and went to Lorelai for help. He convinced Lorelai that they both had something in common because they hated Mitchum and Lorelai was impressed by Logan's moxie.

Lorelai wrote a letter and Rory agreed to give Logan another chance. Logan proved himself even worthy more when he and Rory save the Newspaper under Paris's tyrannical reign. Rory and Logan have a good relationship and they even move in together after Paris's kicks Rory out of their apartment. They also go to Martha's Vineyard with Luke and Lorelai; and Luke looks at him in a new light when he helps Luke with a Valentine's gift. All is well until Rory found out that he had slept with his sister's friends just before Honor's wedding, which causes a more serious rupture.

The rupture ends when Rory realizes that she can't get back at him with Jess because she still loves Logan, and it improves even more when Rory takes care of him after a base jumping accident in Costa Rica involving the Life and Death Brigade. At the end of Season 6, he is sent to London by his father to take charge of his family's business and, according to Mitchum, &quot;set him on a path&quot;. Season 7 sees him acquiring an interest and penchant for his work (in London, then in New York), despite the distance Rory and Logan's relationship continues to grow. Logan surprises Rory with a moonlight picnic on the roof and even though Logan has a attractive co-worker in London he remains faithful. Logan is there for Rory when Richard has a heart attack he borrows a chopper and rushes to her side. He also tells Rory that he has trust in her when Rory admits she has a crush on a T.A.

Later, after getting involved in a bad business venture that brings a lawsuit in Season 7, which causes some tension between Logan and Rory until Logan quits working for his father and Logan apologizes to Rory for neglecting her and work. They go to Stars Hollow and Lorelai finally begins to accept them. Logan asks Lorelai's permission to ask Rory to marry him. Logan proposes to Rory one episode later, but Rory asks for more time to think. Logan makes the offer one last time in the penultimate episode, at Rory's graduation from Yale, saying it's all or nothing. Rory still turns him down saying that even though she loves him she wants a wide open future, and Logan takes the ring back, and walks off. Logan does not make an appearance in the final episode, and the series ends with their relationship still in limbo.

=='''Friends'''==
===[[Lane Kim]]===

Through the whole series they stay best friends. They both live in Stars Hollow and first meet when they are children. Lane is Rory's first friend in Stars Hollow after moving there. While attending Stars Hollow High and Chilton, they spend most of their leisure time together. When Rory moves to Yale they don't have the chance to see each other very often, but they still call each other for a chat or whenever they have a problem.

===[[Paris Gellar]]===

During the years at Chilton, Rory and Paris don't get along with each other that well. Paris can't deal with the fact, that Rory is the better student and gets accepted to Harvard while she is turned down. At first, Rory suffers and can't handle the intimidating Paris, but eventually they get friends - Paris later calls Rory even her best friend - and they live together most of the time at Yale. When Rory gets voted editor of the Yale Daily News because nobody could stand Paris anymore, Paris takes Rory's stuff and puts it on the doorway, which makes Rory move in with Logan.

Rory and Paris share the same idea of important things in life. They work hard for school and university, are in relationships rather than meet new guys every night and don't show much interest in parties.

===[[Madeline Lynn|Madeline]] and [[Louise Grant|Louise]]===

Madeleine and Louise are friends of Paris' during the years at Chilton. They are not very ambitious students and show more interest in boys, parties and fashion. Rory later meets them again in Florida at the spring parties and they once show up in Yale - for a party as well, of course.

===[[Marty]]===

Rory meets Marty in her first year at Yale. He sleeps in the hallway after a party - without any clothes on. She wakes him up and gives him something to wear so he can get back to his room without anybody noticing what had happened. After this incident, their friendship grows and he even admits that he has a crush on her, but Rory is already in love with Logan. Marty later starts a relationship with Lucy, behaving as if he and Rory didn't know each other. When Lucy finds out, she breaks up with him, making Rory feel guilty.

===[[Lucy]] and [[Olivia]]===

Lucy and Olivia are two girls that Rory meets and befriends during her last year at Yale. Rory even takes them home to Stars Hollow, where she has a little break down, because everybody knows exactly what to do after graduation except for her. Rory and Lucy have a fight concerning Marty in Season 7. However, they manage to work it all out.

|Title  = Emily Gilmore
|Actor  = Kelly Bishop
|Image  = Emilygilmore1.jpg
|First  = [[1.01|Pilot]]
|Last   = [[7.22 Bon Voyage|Bon Voyage]]
|Name   = Emily Gilmore
|Age    = approx. 58-64(S1-S7)
|Family = [[Richard Gilmore]] (husband)&lt;br&gt; Carles Gilmore (father-in-law)&lt;br&gt; [[Lorelai &quot;Trix&quot; Gilmore]] (mother-in-law)&lt;br&gt; [[Lorelai Gilmore]] (daughter)&lt;br&gt;[[Rory Gilmore]] (granddaughter)&lt;br&gt;[[Hope]] (sister)}}
'''Emily Gilmore''', played by actress [[Kelly Bishop]], is the wife of [[Richard Gilmore]] and mother of [[Lorelai Gilmore]].

==Character Description==
Emily went to college at Smith and was a History major. She met Richard at a Yale college party, when he was still engaged to Pennilyn Lott. Emily was the &quot;other woman&quot; until Richard broke it off with his fiance after she &quot;showed up to the party in that blue dress.&quot; He proposed to Emily by a bench at Yale University (subsequently replaced by a trash can), they married on June,16,1964 when Emily was 22. You can estimate that she had Lorelai at 23.

Richard and Emily though, in season 4, were separated after Richard pushed Jason out so he could return to Floyd's company and avoid a lawsuit. For a short time Emily stayed at a hotel however returned to the house with Richard moving to the Pool House. They were shortly reunited when a stray dog showed up and they both helped to care for it until its owners were found. However, this was short lived and Emily attempted to date, going to dinner with another man after asking Lorelai how it &quot;worked&quot;. Richard and Emily only truly reunited after he drove into the back of her car at a charity event after seeing her speaking with the man she had been to dinner with. When they returned home they were both obviously unhappy with the situation and Richard moved back into the main house.

Although much of the Gilmore Girls focuses on the relationship between Lorelai and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]], Lorelai and Emily's fractured relationship forms a strong counterpoint to the generally positive relationship between Lorelai and Rory. In season 5-6 Emily goes against Lorelai's wishes and along with Richard allows Rory to drop out of Yale and gets her &quot;do-over with the daughter [she] always wanted&quot; causing a rift between Lorelai and Emily and Lorelai and Rory.

Emily is a dedicated and committed member of her society lifestyle and of the Daughters of the American Revolution [DAR]. She hosts many events and is instrumental in Rory's involvement in the DAR in Season 6. She has a definite eye for detail and is known for her strict requirements placed on people who provide services to her, (a recurring joke is that there is a new maid every episode) most notable are her interactions with her maids who are always &quot;incompetent&quot;. Her history with Maids is a checkered one and includes being sued by a former maid who she had fired for walking too loudly to firing a maid because of Rory's interaction with her. She has had maids from Guatemala, Britain, Ireland, Romania, USA, Portugal, France, Germany and numerous other countries and is constantly criticized for her treatment of them and the expectations she has of them. Though it is mentioned that she pays the best rates.

Although her character provides comic moments, hers is one of the darker characters on the show, being manipulative and vindictive at times. Though this is often not truly the case when it comes to her family. Emily deeply felt the loss of Lorelai and Rory when they left the house a year after Rory was born. Her &quot;manipulations&quot; are often simply an attempt to provide what she believes to be the best for Lorelai, Rory and Richard and to help Lorelai and Christopher be the family &quot;they should be&quot;. The hurt she has felt over the years from missing out on this life is obvious, especially when she learns that Lorelai had broken her leg or when she first sees where Rory grew up at the Independence Inn.

She has reached out to Lorelai numerous times over the years and holds people at arms length as much as her daughter does. When Jason decides on Atlantic City instead of a &quot;stuffy old cocktail party&quot; telling Emily she could &quot;relax and hang out&quot; her conversation with Lorelai was heartfelt and honest, leaving herself vulnerable with her daughter for just a moment. She is very loyal and her family is very important, this is evidenced best when coming to the aid of Lorelai when Christopher ambushes Friday night dinner, asking him to leave, and when she discovers that Lorelai has a back spasm she stays with her to make sure she is looked after.

She is at home in high society, and hosts functions related to Richard's business and her charity work on a weekly basis, and is, of course, very finicky about all of the details. She is a person of taste and appreciates fine things. Both she and Richard are well-traveled and have visited Europe many times. This traveling was shared with Rory at the beginning of season 5 when they traveled Europe together. Outside this world of fancy and niceties, she appears incapable of dealing with her emotions constructively, not wanting to become vulnerable and at times seeming discompassionate.

She is often a misunderstood character with some wanting only to see the negative due to her treatment of Lorelai, though in truth they are much more alike than either of them would ever admit. As far as their relationship goes in comparison to Lorelai's relationship with Rory, Lorelai and Emily are &quot;mother and daughter always&quot; while she and Rory are &quot;best friends first, mother and daughter second.&quot;

'''Richard Gilmore''', played by [[Edward Herrmann]], is married to [[Emily Gilmore]] and is the father of [[Lorelai Gilmore]]. His mother, [[Lorelai &quot;Trix&quot; Gilmore]], has also appeared in several episodes.

== Biography ==
At the start of the series, Richard is the Executive Vice President of the Gehrman-Driscoll Insurance Corporation, and he oversees their international division. He has taken on several different ventures since he was initially forced into retirement. In season 7, he gets a teaching job at the Yale University where he holds lectures on economics, which are attended by his granddaughter Rory. Richard suffered a bout of angina in [[Forgiveness and Stuff|1.10]]. He had a serious second heart attack in [[To Whom It May Concern]] and in [[I'd Rather Be In Philadelphia|7.13]] he undergoes a open-heart surgery that'll leave him inoperative in his job for a good number of the following episodes.

During the time that Rory stayed with Richard and Emily so that she could have a &quot;do-over&quot; he was the first to admit and realize that &quot;the moment they took Rory away from Lorelei, they lost.&quot;

Through the series Richard has adored Rory for her literary taste and sweet nature. He's very protective of her; as shown when he met Dean (her boyfriend during season 2). Richard grills Dean, knowing he's not good enough for Rory. During 'Richard in Stars Hallow' Dean gave Rory a car he made himself, Richard loudly protested (against Lorelai). The two males go to Gypsy's, she finds nothing wrong but Richard makes her check it many times. Dean says he loves Rory, Richard says she's young but doesn't hate Dean, somewhat apologizes for his interrogation. He notices Dean is tall, Dean sarcastically asks if he wants a dance, Richard says &quot;No, thank you. I appreciate the offer though.&quot;

When Rory attends Yale, a Gilmore tradition, she enters a relationship with [[Logan Huntzberger]]. Richard is happy she's with a blue-blood but grieves when he learns Rory isn't a virgin.
==Trivia==
*When he was a boy he loved to eat mock turtle soup.
*He got his first custom-made suit for his father's funeral. He never wore it again, claiming that he grew out of it.
*He was engaged to Pennilyn Lott, but ended up marrying Emily instead, much to his mother's chagrin.
*His father died when he was 10.
*Rory is the apple of his eye, and at times she is all he can talk about.
*One of his hobbies is restoring vintage cars.
*He is somewhat close with Lorelai, and helps her out whenever she needs it (i.e. with Rory's tuition, insurance issues at the Dragonfly, etc.)
*Chilton is only five minutes away from his residence.
*He was on the fencing team at Yale.
*He went to the Bahamas for Christmas one year.
*At times he is overly sensitive.
*When he was a child he used to love going on the roller coasters at Coney Island; he considered them to be faster as a child than they were as an adult.
*He once got so annoyed at street performers in Prague that he hummed Mozart's Prague Symphony to scare them away, and then kept humming it so that tourists would drop money at his feet. Two of them did, and he kept the money.

Season two of [[Gilmore Girls]], an American dramedy television series, began airing on October 9, 2001 on the WB television network. The season concluded on May 21, 2002, after 22 episodes.

The season was released on DVD as a six disc boxed set under the title of Gilmore Girls: The Complete Second Season on December 7, 2004 by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.
==Plot==
Love was in the air at the beginning of the second season of ''Gilmore Girls'', as both Gilmores found themselves in the midst of perfect, giddy relationships--or so they thought. [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] had accepted the proposal of English teacher [[Max Medina|Max]] and was excitedly planning her first wedding; [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] was back on happy footing with townie hunk [[Dean Forester|Dean]] after a dust-up near the end of season one that prompted a mini-break for the teen twosome. However, series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino had anything but smooth sailing on the horizon for her heroines, giving Lorelai a severe case of cold feet and Rory a major distraction in the form of [[Jess Mariano|Jess]], the bad boy newly arrived in town. Soon, Rory found herself extremely attracted to Jess, while Lorelai rekindled the flame of passion that once burned long ago with Rory's father, [[Christopher Hayden|Christopher]], who made his way back into her life despite a girlfriend in the wings.

Season three of [[Gilmore Girls]], an American dramedy television series, began airing on September 24, 2002 on the WB television network. The season concluded on May 20, 2003, after 22 episodes.

The season was released on DVD as a six disc boxed set under the title of Gilmore Girls: The Complete Third Season on May 3, 2005 by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.
==Plot==
Senior year meant some surprising changes for the Gilmore girls, as both [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] wrestled with their pasts in order to figure out what the heck they were going to do with their futures. In the wake of finding out that her relationship with Rory's [[Christopher Hayden|dad]] was not to be rekindled, Lorelai endured a variety of suitors as she attempted to keep her life on an evil keel--not easy when her former flame's girlfriend was pregnant (and clueless), her former fiancé shows up unexpectedly, and her beloved inn suffers some unforeseen damage. If it was minor drama for Lorelai, it was full-fledged soap opera for Rory, who broke up with longtime boyfriend [[Dean Forester|Dean]] in the wake of her attraction to the moody bad-boy [[Jess Mariano|Jess]], only to find her new relationship fraught with difficulties. Add to that the pressure of getting into college (Harvard or Yale?) and stressful senior class politics at the snooty [[Chilton High|Chilton]] private school, and it's a wonder she still had time to crack wise at breakneck speed with her mom and the rest of [[Stars Hollow]].

Season four of [http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/Gilmore_Girls?action=edit&amp;redlink=1 Gilmore Girls], an American dramedy television series, began airing on September 23, 2003 on the WB television network. The season concluded on May 18, 2004, after 22 episodes.

The season was released on DVD as a six disc boxed set under the title of Gilmore Girls: The Complete Fourth Season on September 27, 2005 by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.
==Plot==
The sum of its parts was definitely greater than the season whole as ''Gilmore Girls'' kicked off its fourth year by separating its high-powered mother-daughter duo. After years of toil at snooty private school [[Chilton High|Chilton]], [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] was finally off to the greener pastures of college as she began her first year at Yale. The not-so-long distance put a crimp in her relationship with her mother, [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]], as the two were forced to continue their chatty conversations via phone--not exactly the same as trading barbs face-to-face. While Rory adjusted to college life with cranky roommate Paris in tow, Lorelai found herself without a daughter, but gained a boyfriend in the form of [[Jason Stiles|Jason &quot;Digger&quot; Stiles]], a childhood friend and now her father's business partner. But the lure of [[Stars Hollow]], the Gilmores' cherished country town, would prove too hard to resist, as Lorelai finally made plans to open her own inn, and the two ladies found themselves attracted to town residents--for Lorelai, an intensifying of her friendship with diner owner [[Luke Danes|Luke]], and for Rory, a return to old boyfriend [[Dean Forester|Dean]], which put a decided tension into a show that sorely needed it.

==Summary==
[[Emily]] throws a Friday night birthday party for [[Rory]] and students from Chilton attend. Emily, [[Lorelai]] and Rory confront each other in front of the guests. On Saturday, Lorelai hosts a birthday party for Rory which her grandparents reluctantly attend leading Emily to a shocking realization; she missed out on Lorelai's life. 

==Plot ==
Rory Gilmore is about to turn sixteen years old. But the idea of having a low-key birthday party quickly turns sour when Emily insists on throwing her granddaughter a &quot;proper&quot; party. This all occurs during the weekly Friday night dinner that the girls have with Rory's grandparents. After eating, Lorelai and Rory must put dibs on certain items they want in the swank house. Emily needs to know exactly what the girls want when she and Richard &quot;kick the bucket.&quot;

After looking at different antiques in the house, Lorelai tries her best to put the kibosh on Emily's posh birthday party. (After all, she throws Rory a great bash every year). As usual, Emily's mind is made up and can't be change, so now two parties will be thrown in Rory's honor.

Later on, Lorelai gets a call from Emily; she wants to go shopping for a special present for Rory and needs help. Lorelai agrees because it seems that her mom is actually trying to make an effort to open up. As the two browse through the mall, Emily keeps picking out equally garish gifts, from pearls to hats that belong on the head of the Queen of England. Emily is clearly shopping for her imaginary granddaughter while Lorelai gets increasing annoyed because her suggestions are ignored over and over again. Emily finally finds some bracelets that say &quot;Rory,&quot; but complains that they are only $12, not enough to spend on a present. When Lorelai insists the bracelets fine, Emily makes the purchase and it looks like mother and daughter are really making some headway.

Meanwhile, at school Tristan wishes Rory a happy birthday and reveals that he has an invitation to attend Rory's party. It turns out that Rory's grandmother has given invitation to almost everyone that attends Chilton. The situation is beyond Rory's worst nightmare, but she cannot bring herself to tell Lorelai after seeing her mom so happy about the progress she is making with Emily. She complains to her best friend Lane who offers some warm sympathy while they chow down at the local diner. Next, comes walking in for some java to go. He smiles at Rory and mouths &quot;Happy Birthday,&quot; and we can see Rory swooning inside.

At exactly 4:03am, Lorelai wakes Rory up to wish her a happy birthday. She crawls into bed for with Rory for a sweet mother daughter talk. &quot;I think you're a great kid and the best friend a girl could have,&quot; says Lorelai.

Friday night arrives, and disaster is in the air. Emily is being a psycho host to her hired help, determined to make everything as perfect and possibly. Rory is having a horrible time, forced to mingle with classmates she hates (particularly her arch nemesis Paris) and eat food that smells funny. Tristan arrives to mock her with faux professions of undying love. The one good thing that comes out of this party is that Rory gets a lot of fat envelopes filled with money from stuffy old friends of her grandfather. But when Emily tells Rory to make a speech in front of everyone, she freaks out and makes a fool of Emily. This of course does not sit well with Grandma and Lorelai does not have a clue why Rory is acting totally bizarre. Emily calls Rory the rudest girl in the world and tells Lorelai she ought to be ashamed of herself for being such a bad mother.

Rory hides in Lorelai's old room and then confesses the whole Chilton invitations to her mom. When Lorelai hears Emily invited the snotty classmates on her own accord without consulting Rory, she feels really, really bad. And she feels even worse that Rory kept the news from her so that Lorelai's truce with Emily would not be ruined. As Rory and Lorelai prepare to leave, it has dropped 50 degrees at the elder Gilmore residence. In other words, Emily is as cold as ice and even refuses Rory's invite to her other party the following evening. Now Lorelai is furious at Emily for treating Rory so poorly. They fight like screaming alley cats while Rory waits in the car.

Next morning, Rory is going to a college fair in town so she can pick up another Harvard brochure. While there she meets Paris, who is super annoyed that Rory is at the Harvard table because this means that they both might end up going to school there. The two decide that Harvard is a big campus, so it should be big enough for the both of them. All of a sudden, Paris asks Rory if she is dating Tristan. Due to the fact that Rory practically despises Tristan, she replies with a big, &quot;No.&quot; This makes Paris quite pleased. Pleased enough to tell Rory she had a nice party.

Saturday night arrives and Rory is having a blast with her buds. She gets an iMac from Mom and starts cutting her Sookie-made cake when the doorbell rings. Surprise, it is Emily and Richard! Turns out they have never even set foot in Lorelai's home. Emily feels out of place almost immediately and gets some private time in Lorelai's room. When she spots of picture of Lorelai with her leg in a cast, she makes the sad realization that she doesn't know her daughter at all. She never knew Lorelai broker her leg and it happened three years ago.

Before they leave, Rory gets another big check from Grandpa and is generally happy that they came to her party. As Emily and Richard drive off, there's major sadness hanging all around Emily and it is too strong not to notice, even by her absent-minded husband.

At the end of the night, Lorelai looks out the window and sees to her complete surprise, Rory and a boy. It's Dean, and he's giving her a gift, a bracelet that he made for her. He puts the bracelet on her wrist, puts his hand in hers, and Rory is smitten like a kitten. But Lorelai is a different story.

==Summary==
[[Rory]] has her first kiss with [[Dean]]. [[Lorelai]] is upset Rory didn't tell her about it. Dean attends movie night with the Gilmore Girls. 

==Plot ==
The Autumn Festival has hit Stars Hollow; the leaves are changing, the town is decorating, and Rory is about to experience her first kiss. It happens in public, at the grocery store where Dean works. After school, Rory goes to see her boyfriend and while they stand in an aisle, he holds a soda behind his back and goes in for the lip lock. All Rory can say is &quot;thank you&quot; before bolting from the store and heading straight to her best friend Lane so she can spill every single juicy detail. When she gets home that day, a super crabby Lorelai is dealing with a broken refrigerator, and Rory decides it is not the best time to talk about &quot;the kiss.&quot; Not to mention the fact that the last time Dean was discussed, Rory almost ditched Chilton for him.

When Lorelai goes to pick up a rocking chair from the antique store run by Lane's mom, she finds out about the whole sordid kiss. Lane's mom overheard the girls talking and believes Rory is a bad influence on her daughter. She lectures Lorelai who is more concerned with the fact that Rory did not tell her about any of it. Meanwhile, Lane is obsessed with the kiss and demands to hear the story over and over again. She is living vicariously through Rory and thanks to Dean's best bud, Todd; Lane does have some dirt on Dean. Namely that he had a girlfriend named Beth back in the Windy City, where Dean is from. But they split up before he left after dating for a year. Besides, now she is dating his cousin, which Dean does not feel weird about because he never really loved her. The best part of it all is that Dean has not been able to talk about anything but Rory for weeks.

Lorelai is totally bummed about being shut out by Rory. Luke tries to stay close in order to comfort her, but she just blows him off. When she does talk to Rory, she cannot even bring herself to talk straight, instead going for some random and vague General Hospital analogy. Needless to say, Rory does not pick up on the hint, leaving Lorelai to resort to spying. Luke busts her big time and tells her that Rory's growing up and that there are some things she is not going to share with her mom. What is really disturbing to Lorelai, is that Dean kind of looks like Christopher, Rory's dad. And if Rory does not talk about the guy with her mom, then it is too much like the relationship Lorelai has with her own mother. The only thing left to do is confronting Rory and be really cool about it. So Lorelai ambushes Rory and makes like it is no big deal, but Rory doesn't believe her.

Later, Rory and Lorelai go shopping for their Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory night, which you cannot watch without massive amounts of junk food. Rory's stressed out because they are shopping at the store where Dean works. When Lorelai first sees Dean, her impression? &quot;Boy he's tall, that must have been a back bender, that kiss. Make sure you warm up next time.&quot; They go to check out and with an awkward introduction; Dean bags their junk food. All goes well until Rory and Lorelai leave the store. Rory runs to rent the videos while Lorelai is about to grab a cup of java. But Dean comes out to give them something they forgot, and Lorelai invites him over to watch the movies. The problem is that Rory does not know he is getting the invite. And when she does find out, she freaks.

They have not even had a real date and now their first date will include Lorelai. Rory is humiliated and Lorelai does not get it. What is the big deal? Rory reminds her mom that she is still her mother, not her best friend. Lorelai gets upset and offers to uninvited him. No, that will not work either! How about Lorelai just leaves them alone? No, then it will seem like Rory had her mom arrange the date. It's a lose, lose situation and they are stuck with it. At home, Rory is upset because she does not know what to wear. The night was supposed to be casual and now she has to be pretty. She looks to Lorelai for advice and of course Lorelai knows exactly what to do.

When Dean is late, Rory is about to have a major meltdown. Turns out, he has been held captive by their chatty neighbors. Lorelai quickly rescues him and the date begins. First, he gets a tour of the house and the broken refrigerator. He then takes a look at Rory's very clean room, but she cannot even bring herself to go through the doorway. He senses she is uncomfortable but she claims she is just fine with him looking around her personal, private space. Then, Sookie brings over some dessert, but it is just an excuse to get a little peak at Dean. Lorelai refuses to let Sookie inside, things are bad enough already. But Sookie does indeed make her way into the house, and things just continue on a downward spiral. Rory suggest that Lorelai broadcast the date over the Internet.

Rory, Dean, and Lorelai settle down to watch the movie and talk about other flicks. Then Lorelai goes to get popcorn and decides not to come back, leaving them alone so they can get cozy. Rory cannot handle being alone with Dean. Why? Because he is perfect and smells really good, that is why! She just does not know what to do. It is clear she really likes him, so Lorelai agrees to come back in and help out. But they cannot go back at the same time, that would be too obvious. So Lorelai goes in first and takes the opportunity to have a little one on one with Dean. And she is pretty blunt about it: &quot;That girl in there is beloved around here, you hurt her, there's not a place within a hundred mile you can hide.&quot; Lorelai lays down the law, but Dean has got some backbone of his own and tells Lorelai that he is not going away any time soon. In fact, he really needs Lorelai to like him because if she hates him then he does not have a chance in hell with Rory. Lorelai agrees to try and like him, implying that he has not succeeded in winning her over just yet.

At the end of the night, Rory and Dean are on the porch, and he kisses her again. This one is a little longer and a little sweeter than last time and this time he is the one who says thank you. Inside, Rory knows something is up with her mom. Lorelai is still a little hurt over not hearing about the first kiss and even though it is a little late and after the fact, Rory spills every little detail.

==Summary==
The first snowfall prompts [[Lorelai]] and [[Max]]'s first date while [[Rory]] is stuck in Hartford with [[Richard]] and [[Emily]]. [[Lane]] is upset with Rory for being distracted with Chilton and [[Dean]]. 

==Plot ==
The people of Stars Hollow are about to be walking in a winter wonderland, but first we find Lorelai and Rory at a town meeting, where everyone seems to be arguing over petty matters that the Gilmore girls find highly amusing. The mayor is admonishing the Stars Hollow residents about leash laws before he talks about the anniversary of the legendary Stars Hollow battle. Apparently, the town even has a reenactment of the battle. The whole announcement just infuriates Luke who demands that the whole charade stop. He says that the battle never happened, they are glorifying a war they never fought to keep land that they originally stole anyway. It is not surprising that the mayor is not pleased with Luke's comments.

That night, Lorelai wakes up because she can smell the season's first snowfall in the air. There also happens to be a surprise message on the answering machine. It's from Max, Rory's English teacher at Chilton, and he wants to know if Lorelai and himself are ever going to go on a date. Lorelai is clearly smitten and plays back the message again and again to hear Max's voice.

In the morning, Lane is telling Rory about meeting her soul mate at school. Lane is dressed in her jazz band uniform and is looking pretty. Rory doesn't hear a word coming out of Lane's mouth; she is too distracted, thinking about her boyfriend Dean. She stops by the Inn to grab Sookie's homemade rocky road cookies before jetting off to the bus stop. Lane follows, but then bails when the lovebirds get all mushy. Lane is feeling left out because she is the third wheel.

Meanwhile, it is Friday night and the snowstorm is brewing. It is already hitting Stanford, where Emily and Richard live, so Lorelai is going to have to skip the weekly dinner. Rory arrives at her grandparent's house right after school and finds she is stuck solo without her Mom. No big deal though, Rory will just have to make the best of it. As for Lorelai, she is walking through town digging the first snowfall of the year. She finds Luke, who is still cranky over the battle reenactment. The old men of the town gather in the cold with their muskets while the schools' band sets up to provide a little music. Lane is mesmerized by Mitch, her crush, and then does the unthinkable. She stares at his hair and actually runs her fingers through it! Mitch gives her a look like, &quot;What are you doing?!&quot; and then Lane bolts the scene in total humiliation.

To her surprise and delight, Lorelai runs into Max, whose car has broken down right in Stars Hollow. With Rory away for the night, the two can finally get to have their very first date.

Over at the grandparent's house, Emily is in a tizzy because Florence the cook cannot make it to work. Now, what are they going to do? Rory offers to check the refrigerator and whip something up. (Emily's never whipped up anything in her life.) Rory strikes gold when she spots a frozen pizza putting her grandmother in shock. Emily then declares that the pizza must belong to the maid. After all, that is what you eat at a carnival or a Turkish prison, according to Emily. Rory decides to play chef and banishes the grandparents from the kitchen. Then, while the pizza cooks, a curious Rory goes up to her Mom's old room and does a little snooping. She finds a strip of pictures of her Mom and Dad kissing, from 1983. You can tell Rory gets a bit bummed out seeing her folks at a time when they were totally in love.

Rory decides to call home, but it is Lane who answers the phone. Lane ran to Rory's house after the &quot;Mitch incident&quot; and now she is freaking out. She lays into Rory about what a bad friend she has been. Rory apologizes but it is a day late and a dollar short. Then, the phone goes dead. Leaving Lane high and dry, and Rory feeling like a total jerk.

Meanwhile, Lorelai and Max walk and talk in the snow, flirting and generally charming the pants off each other. Lorelai brings Max to a cozy café where they show old horror flicks, and it is right there on the couch where they share their first kiss.

When the pizza is ready, Emily and Richard dig in, and thanks to a little doctoring with some fresh Parmesan cheese, it is a big hit. After dinner, they all look at some old photos and find Lorelai dressed up in a debutante gown. The conversation immediately gets awkward because Lorelai never got to be an actual debutante because she got pregnant with Rory.

Back in Stars Hollow, Luke feels bad and brings the freezing men some hot coffee while they wait out their reenactment. His good deed backfires when he has to witness Lorelai and Max who are walking back to the Gilmore house looking all chummy. He even spots a lip lock, and the look on Luke's face says it all.

When Lorelai and Max get back to the house, Lorelai does not want to let Max in. She has never brought a man home before out of respect for Rory. And she does not necessarily want to start now. But it is snowing so hard, and Rory is away for the night, so Lorelai breaks her own rule, letting Max over the threshold.

They are barely in the house for like two seconds when they start making out like teenagers and then start making their way up the stairs. Their hot and heavy session is interrupted, when Lane appears out of nowhere. She apologizes, then bolts back into Rory's room and blasts some loud music. That is a big signal for help, so Lorelai sends Max into the kitchen and lends an ear to Lane. Lane gives the lowdown to Lorelai, who gives her best advice. She basically says it is not a big deal, everyone screws up in high school, it is how you handle the experience that matters. Lane feels better after the pep talk, and Lorelai goes back to Max. Lane is now spending the night, so any hoochie coochie between the two is off limits. Max stays the night too, although he does so on the couch and must settle for a kiss goodnight.

The next morning, Rory comes home from her grandparent's house early. Lorelai heads her off at the door and comes clean fast. Rory is definitely weirded out by the situation and asks her Mom if she is in love with Max. Lorelai says she likes Max a lot, but it has only been one date so she cannot tell. But Rory is quick to point out that Lorelai has never had a man in the house before. Lorelai admits she had a great time with Max and only time can tell if he is the right one. Next, Lane comes out of Rory's room, and Rory apologizes for being an awful friend. Rory swears that Lane is not a third wheel and announces that Dean will just have to deal with the fact that Lane came first. They plan for coffee later and then Lane bolts, leaving Rory with her Mom and Max. She is about to join them in the living room, but sees they are sipping coffee and decides to hang solo in the kitchen. As the show ends, Rory pulls out the pictures of her Mom and Dad and looks at them one more time.

What can we do to the episodes pages?

* Add Spoilers?

I think the structure should grow organically as people add new information. Just start somewhere and things will come together :)

Do we need an &quot;actors&quot; category/Portal? - inyia

You can add new portals [[Portal:List|here]] at any time (&quot;All Portals&quot; from the main page goes there), the page is unprotected. Thanks - Admin

I have listed Actors in there, I am going to do the page right now, but it doesn't appear at the &quot;Main Page&quot; and it '''is''' protected, so I can't change it - inyia

Yes, the main page remains protected. I will pull over the Actors portal to the main page soon - Admin

Can we change the pictures to the season 7 boxes. That photos are from season 2. Can we update them? I'm asking because I wanted to make sure it was okay with whoever is putting the boxes to the pages.[[User:Imherestill|Imherestill]] 07:19, November 24, 2011 (UTC)

How do you feel about the idea of having a list of the jobs that Kirk took on? They were never the same in every episode. I'm just not sure if that should be its own page, or attached to Kirk or have a spot for it on the episodes he appears in. What you do all think?</text>

==Synopsis==
During a wild bachelorette party thrown by Sookie, Lorelai makes an impulsive phone call to Rory's dad Christopher and realizes that Max is not the man for her.

==Plot outline==
[[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]], [[Sookie St. James|Sookie]], [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]], [[Michel Gerard|Michel]], and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] go to a drag club for Lorelai's bachelorette party. Emily regales the group with stories about the week before her wedding, some of which give Lorelai pause about her own feelings about marriage. When everyone else leaves to call their sweeties, Lorelai calls [[Christopher Hayden|Christopher]] instead of [[Max Medina|Max]]. Later that evening at home, Lorelai announces to Rory that she's calling the wedding off because she's realized that Max isn't the one for her. Mother and daughter decide to take a road trip to avoid the sympathies of all of [[Stars Hollow]].

}}
'''Lane Van Gerbig (née Kim) '''is [[Rory Gilmore]]'s best friend (next to Lorelai) in Star's Hollow, a friendship that continued over the course of seven seasons, even after Rory moved on to [[Chilton Preparatory School|Chilton]] and then to [[Yale]]. They have been best friends since age four or five.

Lane was raised by a strict Korean mother, [[Mrs. Kim]], who was disapproving of her love for rock music and desire to be a drummer and drove Lane to hide all her rock CDs and forbidden clothing under floorboards and under the mattress in her bedroom. On a rebellious impulse, Lane once dyed her hair purple, but later panicked over what her mother would think of it and dyed it black again ([[One's Got Class and the Other One Dyes|3.04]]). She kept a polaroid photo of her with purple hair, however, which was taken by Rory.

The presence of a Mr Kim is something that is debated amongst fans, with Lane often referring to &quot;her parents&quot;, especially in the earlier seasons, but Mr Kim is never featured in the show.

Lane had a number of romance relationships over the course of the show, the first Henry Cho (Eddie Shin) which ended when he grew tired of hiding their relationship from Mrs. Kim. Lanes next relationship was with with [[Dave Rygalski]] ([[Adam Brody]]). He came into her life after Lane posted a Drummer seeks Band notice, eventually forming Hep Alien with Dave, [[Zack Van Gerbig|Zack]] and [[Brian]]. The relationship had to remain a secret from Mrs Kim, as Dave was not a desirable match, not being Korean or a Doctor. Mrs Kim had repeatedly tried to set Lane up with potential young Korean doctors in the hope of one sticking, so to speak. Eventually, Lane became frustrated with her mother's latest set-up and had her first alcoholic drink at their band's first gig at a teenage party. She makes a drunken phone call to her mother and confesses that she is a drummer in a band and indeed dating Dave Rygalski. Dave was Lane's first kiss (Bible, Kiss, Bible) and the relationship ended after Dave went to college in California.

After Dave left, Lane attended 7th Day Adventist College, at her mother's request, until Lane and her band (Dave now replaced in the band by Gil) had a gig at a club in New York and two in the morning. Unable to come up with an alibi acceptable to Mrs. Kim, Lane instead snuck out of the house. Mrs. Kim realized Lane was gone and later led to the inevitable confrontation between Lane and her mother once Mrs. Kim had ransacked Lane's bedroom and found all the hidden clothes, CDs and make up. Lane then chose to move out. After a few weeks of playing house keeper for Rory and her Yale dorm mates in exchange for accommodation, Lane decided to move into a rental house with her band mates, Zack and Brian. While living with the two of them she continued to work as a waitress at [[Luke Danes|Luke]]'s. She didn't return to 7th Day Adventist College.

Lane's third and final relationship began while she was living in the rental house and she started to develop feelings for Zack. In spite of some initial reservations concerning Zack's reputation as a womanizer and the effect any potential relationship might have on the band, Lane took a chance and confessed her feelings for him and the two began dating. Once more, Lane's relationship was met with disapproval from Mrs. Kim. The couple encountered other obstacles, such as Lane's realization that she wanted to wait until she got married to have sex and Zack sabotaging the band's opportunity with a label by adding a member and changing the set list right before an important gig out of jealousy; he thought Brian had a thing for Lane. Zack soon realized his mistake, however, and proposed to Lane while she was at work at Luke's.

Lane got married to her band-mate [[Zack Van Gerbig|Zack]] in a three part wedding. When Lane's grandmother showed up from Korea, Lane's mother insisted Lane and Zack stage a traditional Buddhist wedding. Once the grandmother left after the Buddhist ceremony, they held a traditional Seventh Day Adventist wedding ceremony to please Lane's mother. Following the ceremony, Lane's mother went home and Lane and Zack had their reception which was a huge bash in the town square with music and drinks and all their friends.

Lane's honeymoon was not very pleasant as she and Zack both got sick, but she came home with a major souvenir - she had become pregnant with twins. Throughout the final season, Lane continued to work at Luke's and attempted to keep the band rehearsing, which started to fall apart as she got closer to her due date. Brian also continued to live with Lane and Zack. Lane gave birth to twin boys, Steve and Kwan, at the end of season 7.

==Trivia==
*The first appearance of Lane's psychedelic closet is in [[The Deer Hunters (Episode 1.04)|S1E4 &quot;The Deerhunters&quot; ]] when Rory calls her.
*Lane's music collection, hidden underneath floorboards, is first shown in [[That Damn Donna Reed (Episode 1.14)|S1E14 &quot;That Damn Donna Reed.&quot;]] '''Accordingly, she classifies her cds in genres:''' classic rock/progressive rock/pretty boy rock, punk/new wave/german metal bands/broadway soundtracks, jazz/jazz vocals/classical/country/rockabilly/Frank Sinatra (The Capitol Years), and then last section, miscellanous.
*Lane's first boyfriend and bandmate was [[Dave Rygalski]], where they bonded over having mutual music tastes as shown from the drummer ad Lane creates in S1E3 &quot;Application Anxiety.&quot; In this episode as well, Lane is wearing a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Kennedys Dead Kennedys ] shirt when she meets Dave.
*She has an aunt, whose name is Joon, and a cousin, whose name is Christine.
*She has an uncle who is around her age. This led to Zack thinking that Mrs.Kim had set her up with him.
*When she went to Adventist college, there were two parks (one for each gender). They also allowed makeup as long as it matched one's skin tone exactly. She considered her life to be over.
*At one point, she became a cheerleader. This was after Rory moved to Chilton, thus leaving her alone.
*She was in the school band. According to her, her band uniform looked like something out of Sergeant Pepper's band.
*Rory became her friend in kindergarten when they decided to share crayons.
*Her godmother to her two children is Rory, a decision she made after seeing how Lorelai smoothed out spats between her and her mother.
*She has a huge CD collection, which is hidden under her bedroom's floorboards. Lane is also knowledgable and opinionated about music, with rock and roll being a particular favorite.
*Her mom was constantly on a health kick, and would make extremely healthy and unappetizing meals; Rory would supply her with junk food because of this.
*Cleverly creates complex ruses to subvert her Mother's overly strict rules; making it possible for her to see her friends, boyfriends, watch TV, own and listen to music, play in the band, dress like a normal teenager, wear makeup and eat junk food.
*Her parents tried to set her up with multiple boys throughout the show. The potential suitors include a future proctologist, pediatrician, minister, and chiropractor.
*Her first crush was Henry Cho, a boy at Chilton who she met at Louise's party. He was everything her parents wanted for her (Korean, respectful, counselor at Vacation Bible School, future pediatrician), and because of that she was hesitant to act on her feelings [[The Breakup, Part 2 (Episode 1.17)|[shown in S1E17 &quot;The Breakup...Part 2&quot;].]]
*Lane serves as a parallel of Lorelai. They have controlling mothers and distant fathers; also, their parents' visions for their lives don't turn out as expected. They have children young (Lorelai at 16, Lane at 22), and are a treasured part of Stars Hollow.
*Her Korean name is Hyung-Hyung [[Sadie, Sadie...|[shown in S2E1 &quot;Sadie, Sadie&quot;]]] .
*She had a high aptitude for sales according to a high school career placement test.
*Her family has Sing-Your-Favorite-Hymn nights [[Kiss and Tell (Episode 1.07)|[shown in S1E7 &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot;]]] .
*The house she grew up in is located on Elm (Street) in Stars Hollow

They started a relationship in Season 7 and got married spontaneously during a trip to Paris, but they separated only a few months later.  
He is also the ex-husband of [[Sherry]] and they have one child together, their daughter [[Gigi]].

==Early History==
Christopher and Lorelai have known each other since age six. They were best friends growing up. Like Lorelai, he came from a privileged family but was unhappy with the life his parents had planned for him. Rather than go to Princeton as his parents wanted, Christopher wanted to travel through Europe with Lorelai after high school. When Lorelai became pregnant, Christopher agreed to get married and work for [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]]'s company, as their parents wanted; however, Lorelai refused. Lorelai raised Rory alone, and Christopher had limited contact with his daughter.

==Storylines==
In Season 1, Christopher comes to Stars Hollow for the first time ([[That Damn Donna Reed|1.14]]). He stays with Lorelai and Rory, and he asks Lorelai to marry him, but she refuses ([[Christopher Returns|1.15]]). Although both his father and Richard brag about Christopher's business success in California, he confesses to Lorelai that his business is in serious financial trouble.

In Season 2, he returns to Stars Hollow to present Rory at her debutante ball ([[Presenting Lorelai Gilmore|2.06]]). He is now living in Boston with his girlfriend [[Sherry Tinsdale]] and has a good job. At the end of Season 2, he is unhappy with Sherry, and he and Lorelai sleep together at Sookie's wedding. Also when Rory and [[Jess Mariano|Jess]] crashes Rory's car ([[Teach Me Tonight|2.19]]), causing the accident that fractures her wrist, Christopher is the person Lorelai calls after seeing Rory's damaged car, and he stays with them for a couple days. However, when he learns Sherry is pregnant, he goes back to her ([[I Can't Get Started|2.22]]). In Season 3, Sherry gives birth to their daughter [[Georgia Hayden|Georgia]], nicknamed Gigi ([[Dear Emily and Richard|3.13]]). 2 years later Sherry leaves him and Gigi to take a job in Paris ([[Norman Mailer, I'm Pregnant!|5.06]]). Christopher repeatedly turns to Lorelai for help with his daughter.

Christopher's presence in Lorelai's life puts strain on her relationship with [[Luke Danes]]. Lorelai stays over at Christopher's house the night she and Rory find out from Richard and Emily that Christopher's father, Straub Hayden, has died, and the both of them drink tequilla all night long, but have no sexual interaction whatsoever ([[Women Of Questionable Morals|5.11]]). At [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]]'s urging, Christopher attends Emily and Richard's wedding vow renewal and begs her to get back together with him ([[Wedding Bell Blues|5.13]]). Lorelai is furious with both her mother and Christopher, and they don't speak for several months. They get back in touch when Christopher wants to financially provide for Lorelai and Rory, and they agree he'll take over paying Rory's tuition at Yale ([[He's Slippin' 'Em Bread... Dig?|6.10]]). After Lorelai and Luke break up at the end of Season 6, Lorelai spends the night with Christopher, and they begin a relationship in Season 7. After accompanying Gigi to France to see her mother, Christopher and Lorelai spontaneously get married, and Christopher moves into Lorelai's house in Stars Hollow. However, Christopher continues to be very jealous of Luke. After he finds a letter that Lorelai wrote for Luke's custody battle, Christopher questions whether Lorelai really loves him ([[To Whom It May Concern|7.12]]). When Lorelai's father has a heart attack, Christopher is upset to see Luke at the hospital ([[I'd Rather Be In Philadelphia|7.13]]). Lorelai considers cutting Luke out of her life completely to save her marriage, but a conversation with Sookie makes Lorelai realize that their relationship isn't right ([[Farewell, My Pet|7.14]]).

}}
'''Lucas &quot;Luke&quot; Danes''' is [[Stars Hollow]]'s local diner owner. He is hinted at being a few years older than Lorelai.
==Character Description==
He has lived in Stars Hollow his entire life, and his dad's hardware store (William's Hardware, in the middle of town) became his diner after his dad passed away. While his father was heavily involved in town events, Luke has resisted all of them, including most Town Meetings and the War Re-enactments. Luke attended Stars Hollow High where he Lettered in Track (hurdles), a successful team that went to the State Finals more than once, and won twice. After his father died, Luke moved into the office above the diner and converted it to an apartment. He lived there alone until his nephew [[Jess Mariano|Jess]] was sent by his mother to live with Luke.

Luke has an ongoing animosity towards Stars Hollow's unofficial leader, [[Taylor Doose]], who continually harasses Luke. Taylor opens an Old Fashioned Ice Cream shop next door, installing a viewing window between the two shops, without asking Luke's permission. Taylor also destroys the shop front of the Diner in [[Season 7]] by causing a car to crash though the front window.

The focal point of much of the show, however is Luke's long term love interest, Lorelai Gilmore. Since Lorelai doesn't cook, Luke feeds [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]. Luke's Diner is included in every episode. It is is a big part of their life. But their relationship runs deeper than that. From episode one, Luke and Lorelai have a chemistry that show writers acted on, although it took four seasons for this relationship to eventuate. In season one, Luke's past flame, Rachel (who is &quot;Elle McPherson pretty&quot;) returns to Luke's life. While happy to see her, he is apprehensive about what this reappearance means, as Rachel is an photographer and was never happy being in Stars Hollow, and left without a word previously. At the end of Season 1, Rachel leaves, citing another woman, Lorelai, as her reason. She says that she could see that Luke loves her even if he has never acted on it. However, Lorelai is engaged at the time and Luke doesn't act. When Lorelai tells Luke that the marriage fell apart, he is joyful and gives everyone free coffee that morning. In Season 3, Luke dates Taylor's lawyer, Nicole; eventually marrying her while on a cruise. This marriage turns out to be a mistake and they divorce when Luke discovers Nicole is seeing another man. This discovery also results in Luke's arrest for beating up &quot;the other man's&quot; car. At the end of season 4, after a flippant remark about self help books by Lorelai, Luke buys a book that makes him realize he is in love with Lorelai (&quot;[[Luke Can See Her Face]]&quot;). After taking Lorelai to his sister's wedding, Luke kisses Lorelai on the opening night of the Dragonfly Inn. In season 5, he takes her out on their first official date and tells her that he has saved a horoscope she gave him on the first day they met in his wallet. He has been pining for her ever since he met her (&quot;[[Written in the Stars]]&quot;).

At the end of season 5, Lorelai proposes to Luke, and he quickly accepts. However, their relationship becomes more and more strained throughout season 6 as Luke pushes away his commitment to Lorelai to deal with the confusion caused due to his daughter, [[April Nardini|April]], who appears in his life as a 12 year old. April is a daughter of Anna Nardini, and old girlfriend of Luke's. He discovers his paternity when April conducts a science fair experiment to discover which of three men are her father. The inclusion of Anna into Luke's life causes much confusion for Luke who is unsure of how to combine his relationship with Lorelai with his blossoming relationship with his daughter. In the season 6 finale, Lorelai gives Luke an ultimatum - marry her now or never. Luke panics, and cannot commit, and Lorelai walks away. In the last scene of Season 6, we find Lorelai waking up in bed with [[Christopher Hayden|Christopher]], Rory's father. 

In Season 7, Lorelai starts dating Christopher as an adult and eventually gets married to him. The relationship between Luke and Lorelai is initially sour, especially after Lorelai tells Luke that she slept with Christopher, in a pivotal scene at the end of [[The Long Morrow|7.01]]. In the scene, Luke drives to Lorelai's house, his truck full of supplies for their elopement, and tells her he is ready, before she tells him what happened. Eventually, a reconciliation occurs, Lorelai ends her marriage with Christopher and begins to rebuild her relationship with Luke. This relationship takes a massive step forward when Lorelai needs Luke's help with purchasing a new car and he goes to great lengths to help her. Audiences see a glimmer of hope in episode &quot;[[7.20 Lorelai? Lorelai?|Lorelai? Lorelai?]]&quot; where Luke returns to his signature blue baseball hat (a gift from Lorelai in [[season 1|season one]]) and a drunk Lorelai serenades Luke with &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; at a karaoke party. The series ends with a kiss between Lorelai and Luke, after he worked all night to throw a goodbye party for Rory. What happens after that, we will never know, but it is strongly implied that Lorelai and Luke end the series romantically involved. You can imagine the bright future of Luke and Lorelai together.

| Name=Paris Geller
| Age=16-22
| Actor=Liza Weil

[[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] meets '''Paris Eustace Geller''' (portrayed by [[Liza Weil]]) on her first day at [[Chilton]]. From the beginning, Paris is a very driven person, putting anything that will get her into her dream school, Harvard, above all else. Throughout high school she seeks out every position she can hold, becoming both editor of the school paper, the [[Franklin]], and president of the student council.

[[Madeline Lynn]] and [[Louise Grant]] are her two oldest friends in high school, though they are very different people. Madeline and Louise care more about boys and fashion then they seem to care about school.

Rory and Paris have an interesting relationship throughout the series. They start out as rivals, as if Paris feels threatened by Rory. She doesn't want to lose her top of the class standing, and feels that Rory could be the one to knock her out of the top. They become friends over Rory's three years at Chilton, though they have several road blocks in their friendship. At the end of their junior year of high school, Paris asks Rory to become her vice-presidential candidate for student council. Over the next year, their &quot;professional&quot; relationship doesn't even keep them friends, as [[Francie Jarvis]] manipulates Paris into thinking that Rory broke her trust by telling about her boyfriend, [[Jamie]], who she meet over the summer in Washington D.C. at the leadership camp she attended for student government.

After Paris is rejected by Harvard at the end of her senior year in Chilton, she later surprises Rory on her first day of [[Yale]] as her new roommate. Paris had arranged it after her life coach, [[Terrance]], told her that her &quot;journey&quot; with Rory wasn't quite over. In her freshman year at Yale, Paris joins the [[Yale Daily News]] and ends up breaking up with her boyfriend Jamie for an older man, who is a professor. She begins dating Professor [[Asher Flemming]], and ends up traveling with him to England, where he dies during one of his classes. She spends the beginning of her sophomore year grieving for him and also set up a wake.

It is also said during season 4 that Paris thinks Richard Gilmore (Rory's Grandfather) is good looking! Rory tries to ignore this comment.

During her sophomore year, she begins dating [[Doyle]], the editor of the Yale Daily News, and at the beginning of her Junior year (season 6) she is made editor of the Daily News. She becomes power crazy and won't let anything go to print without it being perfect by her standards, which drives the rest of the staff of the paper to oust her. She is replaced with Rory, which results in her being kicked out of their apartment. Rory has no other option but to move in with her boyfriend, [[Logan Huntzberger]]. Rory and Paris become roommates again (along with her boyfriend Doyle) (in season 7), this time with a binding lease so that Paris can't move every item of Rory's out into the hall again.

In preparation for graduation, Paris institutes &quot;Operation Finish Line,&quot; with Rory, an obsessive program designed to maximize their choices after graduation. This succeeds beyond her dreams, and she is accepted to multiple law schools and medical schools. Paris is immediately distressed about finally having to make a choice that will have such a profound effect on the remainder of her life. To this end, in order to think rationally and clear her plate of any undue influence, she breaks up with Doyle. Doyle however, will not accept her breakup and vows to follow her wherever she goes.

Paris then decides that she would be going to medical school as she had always dreamed to be a doctor.

'''Stars Hollow''' is the small town [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] live in.

The show Gilmore Girls takes place in a make-believe town, that Amy Sherman-Palladino created, called Stars Hollow. Lorelai came from a wealthy family with everything open to her, but ended up in the small town in Conneticut. Through out the show you learn about how Stars Hollow was founded and how it was named. The Revolutionary War plays a frequent role in the town's past. But what really makes this town so special are the people living there and the businesses that are so very popular.

==Background==

Anna had no inclination to tell Luke that he had a daughter. April only did the DNA test to win a science fair. Luke, after the slightly strange confrontation with April, decided to go down to the science fair and find out the results. Luke and April have grown to know each other at Luke's insistence and she has endeavored to introduce Luke to new things, like Target stores.

April and Lukes relationship gets better and better after Lukes goes on class tour to philaldelphia with April. They start doing a lot of stuff together, but Luke does not want Lorelai to get involved with April, because he is afraid that she will like Lorelai better than him.

But when Luke decides to throw April a bithday party, and everyone is really bored, Lorelai comes to help out. Everything goes fine until Anna finds out that Luke left Lorelai alone with the kids all night. She doesn't want that and after that April becomes a breaking point in Luke's and [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]]'s relationship, whereby Lorelai forces Luke to make a decision about their planned wedding, despite the additional complications posed by April, that Luke became overwhelmed with. Luke refuses to make a decision, which leads to a breakup at the end of [[Season 6]].

In Season 7, Anna's mother gets very sick and Anna goes to live with her for a few months. In the meantime, April lives with Luke in Stars Hollow and goes back and forth to her school. Anna returns and tells Luke that she is going to move to New Mexico to be with her mother, taking April away from Luke. Luke gives Anna a proposal, of how often he would like to see April. But, Anna declines it, telling him that since she is her mother, that leaves all decisions up to her. Luke goes and yells at Anna and tells her it is not fair what she is doing to him, since she didn't even tell him that April existed. After that, Anna prohibits him from seeing her at all. Luke sues Anna for joint custody, and with a big help to Lorelai's character reference wins the case. With that, he gains custody to have April for either Christmas or Thanksgiving, spring break, and a month of the summer. She returns to Stars Hollow a couple of times in the rest of the series after Anna and her move away.[[File:Screen_shot_2012-07-30_at_11.30.53_PM.png|thumb]]

==Summary==
Chilton hosts a dance which [[Rory]] and [[Dean]] attend, confirming they are &quot;boyfriend-girlfriend.&quot; [[Emily]] sleeps over at [[Lorelai]]'s to take care of Lorelai's injured back. Rory and Dean fall asleep accidentally, causing Rory to arrive home at 5 a.m., which pushes Emily to think they had sex. This causes another blow up between Lorelai and her mother. 

==Plot ==
Richard is away in Prague, so it's just the girls on Friday night, and Emily knows from the Chilton newsletter that there's a formal coming up. But Rory doesn't think she'll go. Emily just can't understand why, so she blames Lorelai who clearly must have encouraged Rory to develop disdain for formals. Lorelai ignores the accusations, but in the car home, Lorelai wants to know why Rory's not going. After all, she's never been to one and is probably basing her opinion on one viewing of Sixteen Candles. Lorelai just doesn't want Rory not to go because she's afraid. Does Rory not join in on stuff because she really doesn't want to or because she's really just shy? Maybe Rory is just shy, so that means she might be going to her very first dance. And that means asking Dean to go with her.

But what if he says no? Lane says there's no point in having a boyfriend if he won't go to a dance with you. Rory isn't really sure if he's her boyfriend or she's his girlfriend. Maybe it's time to have a talk with him? Lane wants Rory to ask Dean right then and there while he's bagging groceries. (Her mom took away the TV after she caught Lane watching VIP so she needs some form of entertainment.) Rory agrees to take the plunge and ask her &quot;boyfriend&quot; to the Chilton formal.

While Dean puts the new green-bean shipment on the shelf, Rory does her best to ask Dean out, but he's not a joiner and doesn't really &quot;do&quot; dances. However, he can tell Rory really wants to go, even though she tries to play it cool. Dean agrees to the dance, even though he has to wear a coat and tie. Rory is so excited that she plants a kiss right on him in the vegetable aisle.

Later, Lorelai goes to work on a fancy dress for Rory, and Emily, for one, is thrilled about Rory's attendance, although she's not that happy about the homemade duds. Her only request is that Lorelai take lots of pictures so she can mark this once in a lifetime event. After all, Emily won't be there to see it. In the end, her whining gets her an invite on Saturday to watch Rory go to the dance.

Rory gets in line to buy dance tickets at school, and Tristan is desperate to know whom she's taking. He claims he wanted to ask her himself. Rory doesn't buy it; why would she want to go anywhere with Tristan, ever? Paris overhears her and refuses to believe that Rory might bring someone better than Tristan.

Saturday night arrives, and Rory looks like a dancing queen, hairspray, heels and all. Emily arrives with her camera and thinks Lorelai actually bought the dress because it looks so good. When Rory tries to run out, Emily refuses to let her go; Dean must come to the door, it's the proper thing to do. He honks and honks (this was the agreed upon plan) and honks until finally he comes to the door and gets ambushed by Emily. After brief introductions, Rory and Dean bail quickly, leaving Emily to grill Lorelai about the merits or lack thereof in regards to Dean. Then, to the horror of Lorelai, Emily insists on staying the night because Lorelai is having a back spasm and can't move off the couch.

On the way to the dance, Rory starts having second thoughts, maybe they shouldn't go. Dean is agreeable to whatever she wants. But when he tells her that she looks amazing, Rory suddenly feels like the night won't be so bad after all. When they get there, the place looks pretty amazing too, and Dean suggests that they dance (just a little) before they bail on the event. Dean catches that attention of some Chilton girls, Louise and Natalie, particularly nasty girls who flirt shamelessly with Dean until he puts his arm around Rory and makes it very clear that he's taken. Then Rory and Dean slow dance, and Dean kisses her while Tristan watches from afar. Looks like he's got a little longing in his eyes.

While Dean gets punch, Paris's date, Jacob, tries to ask out Rory. Turns out Jacob is Paris's cousin, which makes Rory smile, but that doesn't mean she's at all interested. He doesn't hold a candle to Dean. Meanwhile, Lorelai and Emily are actually having a nice time together. Emily even compliments Lorelai on the job she did with the dress and with Rory.

After a little time at the dance, Dean suggests leaving, getting a cup of coffee, and hanging, just the two of them. Rory's down with that; and while he gets their coats, Paris demands to know how many people know that she brought her cousin to the dance. Paris freaks out, starts yelling and essentially spills her own beans to the whole Chilton class. Tristan meanwhile confronts Dean, gets up in his face, and starts to cause trouble. Dean gives just as good as he gets, but Tristan keeps the insults flying; he's clearly trying to start a fight. Rory tries to stop it, but Tristan then gets up in her face. Dean pushes him aside and then, boom, it's a little fight. &quot;You will not come near her ever again,&quot; are Dean's final words to Tristan.

Back at the Gilmore house, Lorelai falls asleep on the couch, and Emily tucks her in. It's a sweet mother/daughter moment, especially when a sleepy Lorelai whispers, &quot;Thank you, Mommy.&quot; The look on Emily's face almost breaks your heart.

Meanwhile, Rory and Dean sip coffee and talk about the night's events. Rory doesn't know how to feel, having her boyfriend defend her honor. Boyfriend? Rory backs up and starts rambling, she doesn't think Dean is her boyfriend. But, then has to ask, is he her boyfriend? Dean says he is if she wants him to be. She does, so he is. As they walk in town, they pass Miss Patty's dance studio, which has been left unlocked. They take a little tour. Then, Dean gets a feel for Rory's purse, which is pretty heavy because there's a book inside. A book? Well, it's just a habit of Rory's, she takes one wherever she goes. And tonight, she's got The Portable Dorothy Parker. They spend the rest of the night reading and smooching and then fall asleep right there. In the morning, Miss Patty and her dancers find them conked out and wake them up. Rory bails alone even though Dean begs to go with her so he can explain the situation to her Mom. Rory refuses to let him go; all she knows is that she has to get home now!

As for Lorelai and Emily, they are having a meltdown of course, until Miss Patty calls to give them the details. So what really happened? Before Rory gets there to explain the details, Emily assumes the worst but Lorelai isn't ready to judge her daughter. And any closeness these two had goes right out the window. Basically, if Emily can't see the good that Lorelai has done, the life she's built and the beautiful daughter she has, then Emily shouldn't be in this house. Emily walks out as Rory comes home. Despite her daughter's apologies, Lorelai freaks out on Rory, big time. How could she do this, especially when Emily was there to witness it? So, is this about Emily or Rory? Lorelai tells Rory she should go on the pill, but that's crazy talk and Rory knows it. Lorelai knows it deep down too. Rory admits she made a mistake and fell asleep, but that's all it was and she shouldn't have to take crap from Lorelai because of a huge fight with Emily. Rory heads to her room, clearly upset about her mom's lack of trust, and this is one fight that won't be resolved right away.

'''Logan Huntzberger''' was [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]'s third serious boyfriend.

==Character description==
Logan is the son of [[Mitchum Huntzberger]], a successful newspaper magnate. Logan attended a variety of boarding schools in Massachusetts such as Groton, Rivers, Exeter, and Andover where it is presumed that he graduated. The Huntzberger family is what can be described as &quot;old money&quot;. It is shown that his father loves Logan but at times treats him more like an heir than his son. His mother [[Shira Huntzberger|Shira]] tends to be snobby even though she doesn't come from &quot;old money&quot; herself. Logan and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] met while attending [[Yale]] through Rory's friend [[Marty]]. Both Rory and Logan worked at the [[Yale Daily News]], although Logan's appearance in the news room was uncommon and annoyed [[Doyle McCaster|Doyle]], the editor of the Yale Daily News every time he did bother to show up. Logan often refers to Rory as &quot;Ace&quot; because she wants to be a reporter. The nickname becomes a sweet term of endearment. Rory enlists Logan's help on a article for a secret society Logan was in called the [[Life and Death Brigade]]. Logan takes her to a secret event party in the woods ([[You Jump, I Jump, Jack|5.07]]).

Through that event, Rory becomes fascinated with the club and with Logan. She is convinced to take a dangerous jump with Logan. After this, Logan and Rory's paths cross more developing a tentative friendship with Logan comforting Rory at a party her grandparents threw for her where [[Dean Forester|Dean]] broke up with her. Logan causes a fake fight for Rory as a prank but Rory gets him back by enlisting her grandfather to trick them into an engagement. Rory soon develops a crush on Logan and admits it at her grandparents vow renewal. Logan admits he likes her back but is not a commitment guy. Therefore, Rory and Logan agree to a no-strings relationship that lasts until mid S5 when Rory realizes that she can't do it and wants to be friends again. However, Logan takes it as a ultimatum and the two of them start dating. Rory is Logan's first serious girlfriend, except for when he was ten and claimed actress Alyssa Milano held the position, as revealed by his sister Honor. Rory and Logan's relationship survives many hurdles first his mother's and grandfather's disapproval of Rory because she wants to work instead of staying home and planning parties. However, Logan does not pay heed to what his family says and still stays with Rory. Logan also comforts Rory when his father says that Rory is not cut out to be a journalist. Logan supports Rory when she decides to take a break from Yale even though he believes that she will eventually come back to Yale.

Logan suffered a grievous injury during a trip with The Life and Death Brigade. Logan has been strongly encouraged, even forced, by his father to enter the family business.

At the end of season six, Logan moves to London to join his family business. Surprisingly, after the conflict he suffers with his father earlier, he takes his new responsibilities seriously, and does his job well.

Unfortunately, after he loses money after a badly thought-out investment in a new media company (the company violated another person's patent rights, and the third company waited until a larger company with deeper pockets bought it to sue for infringement), Logan regresses and acts irresponsibly once more by taking a trip to Vegas with Life and Death Brigade colleagues, Colin and Finn. He finally tells his father that he won't be part of the family business anymore, and starts to straighten out again.

After he gets an offer for a new job in California, Logan proposes to Rory. She considers, but turns him down, feeling she wants to accomplish other things first. She asks if they can continue their relationship in a long distance form but Logan decides that it would be too hard for him to continue seeing Rory after the proposal and after moving, he gives her an ultimatum, all or nothing. Rory decides that she can't do that so the heartbroken Logan breaks it off with her.

'''Miss Patty''' runs a dance studio in [[Stars Hollow]] and had a career in show business as a dancer. She is notorious gossip who frequently shares information with [[Babette Dell]] among others. Soft-married, oft-divorced dance instructor. She often makes name-dropping references to her past as a dancer and singer; how much of it is true is unknown. She's usually seen lusting after young men and wishing she could marry again. She and Babette know most of the gossip of the town, though Babette mentions that Patty normally gets the town gossip before her because her phone intercepts other people's phone calls. After (or perhaps even before) Taylor, she seems to be the most influential citizen of Stars Hollow. Her dance studio is used for town meetings, among other community events.

Just browsing through a couple of pages of the supporting cast and I am just wondering about two things: 1, why are there Fan Reactions in the articles? They don't appear to offer any relevant information at all, and 2, even if they did, where are the sources? Yes, I know they are fan reactions, but which fans? Where is this information coming from? I'd delete it right away for the sole reason that they're irrelevant to the article, but I'll hold off on that for a bit as some of the traits listed can be put under a Personality section (though I am against that until sources are confirmed). [[User:Kaldelar|Kaldelar]] 20:31, January 29, 2012 (UTC)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- I agree. I cringe every time I see that section of an article. It's simply not relevant, and it's not objective.
&lt;br&gt;[[User:Xificanthaveyou|Xificanthaveyou]] 21:58, February 1, 2012 (UTC)

That's all I need, Xifi. I'll muck out right away :) And while we're at it, can people who are more familiar than me with seasons 6 to 7 fill out some of the stub articles? Thank you.[[User:Kaldelar|Kaldelar]] 23:37, February 8, 2012 (UTC)</text>

Done! You can use the 'move' link on top of any page to rename it - any links with the old name are automatically redirected. Btw, a handy way to sign comments is using &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; (four tilde characters in a row) - [[User:Admin|Admin]] 10:51, 10 December 2006 (PST)</text>

You can supply the image size to the Image command .. for example: 
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Lauren_Graham.jpg|150px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives:

Yeah some things are hard to find for mediawiki. Anyway, I fixed up the Infobox_cast template, let me know if you want changes/additions. The picture is bigger again, but changing dimensions breaks the template somehow, and I am still kinda new to that - [[User:Admin|Admin]] 11:35, 12 December 2006 (CET)

'''Sookie St. James''' (portrayed by [[Melissa McCarthy]]) is, next to [[Rory]], the best friend of [[Lorelai]]. We get to know her as the chef of the [[Independence Inn]] and she eventually co-owns the [[Dragonfly Inn]] with Lorelai. Sookie is a quirky, fun-loving person who is always bubbly and upbeat. However, she is often overly perfectionist with her food creations, and tends to create havoc in the kitchen when she is in top form. In season one Sookie goes on a date with the Inn's produce man, Jackson Belleville. The two get into fights over food orders and other small things as they did before they began dating. Their first date begins awkwardly as a double date with Lorelai who is set up with Jackson's cousin Rune, but leads to a relationship between the two. They fall in love and get married in season two. During the show Sookie and her husband have two children, and another along the way at the end of season seven.

'''Jackson Belleville''' is a farmer and the produce supplier for the [[Independence Inn]] and later on the Dragonfly Inn. He would frequently get into fights about the quality of the vegetables with [[Sookie]]. Sookie asks him out on a date in [[1.11]]. Their first date is an awkward double date with [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and Jackson's cousin [[Rune]], but once they ditch Rune and Lorelai, they have a good time together ([[Double Date|1.12]]). Jackson proposes to Sookie during the &quot;[[A Tisket, A Tasket|Stars Hollow Bid on a Basket Fundraiser]]&quot;, and they get married at the Independence Inn in the [[I Can't Get Started|Season 2 finale]]. They have two children, Davey (born in Season 4) and Martha (born in Season 5/6), and during Season 7 Sookie is pregnant with their third child.

In Season 5, Jackson defeats [[Taylor Doose]] to become Town Selectman ([[Tippecanoe and Taylor, Too|5.04]]). However, he dislikes being Town Selectman, and eventually Taylor takes over the position.

'''Michel Gerard''' is the hilarious concierge of the [[Independence Inn]] and later the [[Dragonfly Inn]]. He is often grumpy, sometimes unpleasant, a militant health nut, but always manages to remain lovable somehow. He finds other French people odious, fears that his suits will be a deduction when the inn has to cut down on spending.... in short, you can't live with him, can't live without him. He accompanies [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and [[Sookie St. James|Sookie]] through all of their business adventures. As Lorelai once put it: &quot;We are addicted to you&quot;. He also has two dogs, Paw-Paw and Chin Chin. Chin Chin passed away in the 7th season. He is French. He and Sookie don't really get along well.

==Trivia==
*Michel loves Celine Dion and has seen her in concert six times.
*He hates children, but volunteered to look after Davey due to paranoid feelings about Tobin.
*Michel lived in France until he was 17, after which he left for unknown reasons.
*A ballerina and an ensemble performed at his graduation.
*He and his mother are very close-they always go shopping together, watch movies, and gossip whenever she's in town.
*A notorious health freak, he's known to reject omelets if they aren't made from egg whites. He'll count the blueberries in his pancakes as well. One time, he weighed what he was going to eat due to hearing that it would help extend a rat's life and thus his. Also, he freaked out once upon hearing that his fat free creamer was actually two percent, and ran in place to try and burn off the excess calories.
*He loves to dance, but he is terrible at it.

'''Max Medina''' is [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]'s English teacher at [[Chilton]] and [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]]'s ex-fiancee.

Rory is in Max's English class during her sophomore year, and she gets a D on her first paper for his class. When Rory misses a Shakespeare test due to tardiness, Max offers to let her do extra credit to make up for the missed test ([[1.04]]). Max asks Lorelai on a date at the Chilton bake sale ([[1.05]]), and the two begin a relationship. Lorelai ends things when she realizes how much she and Rory like having Max in their lives. Max is extremely hurt, but after the headmaster threatens to fire him for having a relationship with a Chilton parent, he decides they shouldn't be together ([[1.11]]). Several months later, Lorelai shows up at his apartment late one night, and they start seeing each other again ([[1.17]]).

Max proposes to Lorelai in the [[1.21|Season 1 finale]], and she accepts several days later ([[2.01]]). They plan a wedding for the end of the summer, but Lorelai calls off the wedding only a few days before the wedding after realizing that she doesn't love Max ([[2.03]]). When school starts, Max and Rory are very awkward around each other; when Rory is assigned to interview Max for the school paper, they both express their regret that the wedding didn't happen.

At some point, Max goes to California to teach a class at Stanford, where he dates a woman named Diane. He returns to Hartford for the Chilton bicentennial, and he runs into Lorelai several times. Although he tells her that he is fine with how things ended, he kisses her, then admits he isn't over it ([[3.16]]). His last appearance is in ([[3.19]]), where he is on the parents' committee for the Chilton graduation party with Lorelai. She seems interested in starting a relationship again, but he insists that he wants her to stay away from him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="571">I have added some quotes from the episode in this one. If you like I can try and write some more on the other ones.

On the other hand, do you want to add music from the chapters (song and performer)? Because it can be another Section in every chapter. Maybe we can add if there appears some new character or a Guest Star

|Age = 24

}}
'''Dean Forester''' was [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]'s first boyfriend and plays a recurring role in her life.

== Biography ==
Dean first appeared in the [[Pilot]] where he was the new boy at [[Stars Hollow High School]] to which he had come from Chicago with his family. We discover that he had been watching Rory and was impressed by her concentration while reading. Before Rory went to Chilton, she and Dean met and it was like shy love. Rory even debated not going to [[Chilton]] so she could stay with Dean at [[Stars Hollow High School|Stars Hollow High]]. They had a quiet flirtation, and he gave Rory a bracelet for her birthday which he made out of a coin.

Rory and Dean shared their first kiss at [[Doose's Market]] where Dean worked. Dean initiated this kiss by offering Rory free &quot;pop&quot; where he made her guess which one was behind her back and then kissed her &lt;small&gt;([[Kiss and Tell]])&lt;/small&gt;. During [[Rory's Dance]] it is decided that they are officially boyfriend and girlfriend. In the same episode, Dean and Rory's (in her opinion) rude and annoying classmate,[http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/Tristan_DuGrey Tristan DuGrey], who &quot;has a thing&quot; for Rory.  Despite this, they continue to date happily until the episode [[Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers]] when Dean reveals that he is building Rory a car for her anniversary and tells her that he loves her. Rory reacts badly to this, stating that she needs time and this is a big step to take. In the [[The Breakup, Part 2|following episode]] Rory reveals that Dean broke up with her because she didn't respond with &quot;I love you too&quot;. This break, however, doesn't last long, in the [[Love, Daisies and Troubadours|final episode]] Rory drops significant hints (like at the town meeting) that she misses Dean and really does love him, resulting him turning up at Chilton where Rory tells him that she loves him and they get back together.

Their relationship goes well until the arrival of Luke's nephew, [[Jess Mariano]], whom Rory finds more and more attractive. They both share the same interests in both literature and music. Rory feels confused about him at first since she knew he was trouble, but she still ends up being good friends with him. This causes Dean to become very possessive of Rory, until Lorelai tells him to back off and calm down - he does so but in the [[Back_in_the_Saddle_Again|18th episode]], Lorelai finds him on their porch where he simply states that &quot;She likes Jess, doesn't she?&quot;
In [[Season 3]], Dean breaks up with Rory at a town dance after her insistent attention to Jess over him and he calls out on Rory how he knows how she feels and claims he's &quot;out&quot;. 
Rory later climbs a tree to knock on Dean's window, attempting to apologize for her behaviour and claims that she really did love him: a tearful Dean accepts her apology and closes the window on her. However, Dean soon befriends Rory again and the two seem to be all right.

It is revealed that Dean is seeing a girl named [[Lindsay Lister]] and Dean proposes to her at the end of season 3 - a few days after a fistfight with Jess who treated Rory poorly at a party.  Dean marries Lindsay in [[Season 4]], and while their marriage is a happy one at first, cracks begin to show and Rory and Dean seem to grow closer as time goes by. Lindsay may not be the one for Dean, but she certainly tried very hard to be a good wife and felt hurt when Dean brushed her efforts aside and yelled at her for answering her husband's cellphone. She overhears Rory hating on her, saying that she doesn't know what's good for Dean, and tells him to stay away from Rory. It finally culminates in Dean cheating on Lindsay with Rory - Dean claims he's leaving her, but while Rory is in Europe, he stays with his wife until she finds a letter written by Rory - she promptly throws his stuff out of their apartment and they file for divorce. 
Dean and Rory begin dating but the tension and time apart has clearly taken its toll and the couple find themselves unable to go on dates as Dean works three jobs and Rory has school. They find the time however on the same evening Rory's grandparents throw her a party, but as a slightly tipsy and bejewelled Rory arrives late for her pickup, Dean simply states that he doesn't belong here anymore, having realized that their lives are too different and heading in different directions, and Rory only answers with a sympathetic &quot;Dean...&quot;: this breakup is the final one the couple have.

His final appearance is in [[To Live and Let Diorama]] where he relates his faulty relationship with Rory to Luke's with Lorelai, saying that ultimately, Luke would hold Lorelai back from whatever potential she may have. With this statement, Dean is never heard from again.

==Summary==
[[Richard]] has a heart attack during a Christmas party that [[Lorelai]] was uninvited to. The medical emergency causes [[Emily]] and Lorelai to forgive each other and brings [[Luke]] and Lorelai closer. 

==Plot ==
Part II of a Gilmore Girls Christmas opens with Lorelei and Rory avoiding each other while helping out at the rehearsals for the town's Christmas pageant. Tensions are apparently still running way high after Rory's impromptu sleepover with Dean.

The next day, Rory and Lane talk, and Rory fills Lane in on the Dean details, including his new nickname of Narcolepsy Boy. She's bummed that everything seemed platinum until they nodded off that fateful night. Rory also tells Lane about buying Dean Kafka's The Metamorphosis. Lane thinks this is a totally lame Christmas gift and urges her to get something that says, &quot;I dig you, baby.&quot;

Later at the inn, Lorelai has a run-in with her mother about Christmas dinner. It seems that Lorelai is into going; however, she can't come until eight and cocktails are at six. When she balks at leaving work early, Emily tells her not to come and just send Rory. It seems Mom is still mad about the way Lorelai went off on her when she got upset that Rory didn't come home.

Rory heads off to the party all by her lonesome, leaving Lorelei alone to order pizza in and get extremely restless. When her pizza doesn't come on time, she wanders off into town to Luke's.

Meanwhile, at Grandma and Grandpa's, Rory is dining with the adults. Grandpa Richard is stressing out with his work buddy over some power shifting in his company. Not able to let it go, he decides to try to get to the bottom of things by phoning London at that very minute. He is unable to find anything out, so he returns to the table still mega-stressed. As the dinner commences, he complains of being warm and goes to lower the thermostat while Emily tells a tall tale about Lorelei's absence, she's sick, much to Rory's amazement. The discomfort of that ends as Richard keels over from an apparent heart attack.

Rory leaves her Mom a message on her cell phone just as Lorelai is preparing to consume a special Santa burger that Luke has so lovingly made for her. Lorelai gets the message and wigs out so badly that Luke has to announce an impromptu closing of the diner so he can drive Lorelei to the hospital.

When they finally get to the hospital, Emily has had a full-on meltdown, not being in control of the scene, not knowing what's going on while Richard is receiving care behind closed doors. At one point, she even excuses herself and goes off to call Lorelai once at her home and leave a message. Just as she's being beyond obstinate with a desk clerk, Lorelai swoops in to help save the day. Her Mom is impressed with how she defused an explosive situation and goes off to secure her hubby a first-rate room with a view.

Luke comforts Lorelai at the hospital, even though he hates hospitals and sick people. He starts to look all green at one point and Lorelai says she thinks he should go home because he doesn't look like his &quot;good&quot; normal self. This piques his interest and he wants to know how good he usually looks.

While Emily and Rory go in to see Richard, as he lies recuperating, Lorelai does anything but; she is avoiding the situation at all costs. She doesn't want to see her Dad lying in a bed, suffering and weak. Scared she'll lose him just when she's found him again. She does finally goes in, after Emily and Richard share a tender moment, and just as father and daughter lock eyes but before they can speak, doctors rustle into the room to issue instructions. Turns out he's going to be just fine, but he'll have to change his lifestyle. It was angina, not a full-on heart attack.

Later, Lorelai tells Rory that Dean had visited their house earlier and she forgave Dean and realized, after he reassured her, that she didn't have to worry about him derailing any of Rory's plans for Harvard (or life for that matter) and he would never hurt her. Lorelai knows that he's a good kid and urges Rory to go home with Luke and call Dean and be all mushy with him. Lorelai is going stay and offer to help her Mother, even though Emily needs help from no one. Emily is actually glad to have the company and they both go down to the cafeteria to get something to eat, a truce clearly having been called.

The next day, Lorelai gives Luke a new blue cap to thank him for his help. They watch the Christmas processional rehearsal together and Lorelai comments that she can't imagine living anywhere else. She also tells Luke that he looks good in his new cap and of course, he wants to know how good.

==Summary==
[[Lorelai]] attends Chilton Parents' Day and [[Paris]] sees her kissing [[Max]]. Paris spreads the news, but when [[Rory]] turns on her and offers friendship they declare a truce. [[Sookie]] asks [[Jackson]] on a date. 

==Plot ==
As the show begins, we find Lorelai and Rory walking through the center of Stars Hollow, discussing who's turn it is to clean out the refrigerator. It is then that they spot puppies in the park looking for a home. Lorelai considers adopting a dog, but Rory, and Luke, who just happens to come by, both point out the fact that she isn't exactly Dr. Dolittle. In fact, Lorelai once abandoned a hamster. So, for now, Lorelai must give up her dreams of having a pet, Rory will have to be enough; she can fetch slippers, but she draws the line at wearing a collar.

That night, Lorelai and Max are having a hot and heavy dinner date at his place. Lorelai can't help but ask if he's read Rory's latest paper. She thinks it's brilliant, although she's clearly biased. In fact, she suggests that Max just give Rory an A, without reading it at all, but that wouldn't be fair to all the other students whose mothers aren't dating Chilton's cutest English teacher. Oh well, that just leaves them more time to make-out and then sashay into the bedroom for a little private tutoring. Lorelai doesn't get home 'till 1:00am and finds Rory waiting up for her. Rory spent the night doing homework, but Dean did call five times, pretty respectable but not an all-time high.

At Chilton, Rory's sitting in English class while Paris's best buds, Madeline and Louise, talk about how hot Max is and whether or not he has a girlfriend. If so, who she is and what's she's like. Paris says that who ever she is, she's a big fat loser. Of course, Rory overhears all this and keeps her mouth shut about the truth. Paris is just bitter about her parent's divorce, which is the talk of the school.

At the Friday night dinner, Emily wants to know if Lorelai is going to Chilton's annual parents day. Lorelai had no idea it even existed, as she has not yet read the Chilton newsletter. This is not winning points with Emily, who offers to go in Lorelai's place, that'll happen over Lorelai's dead body.

When Lorelai has her next date with Max, he shows up on time (horror of horrors!). Lorelai isn't ready, which means Rory has to answer the door. This breaks their rule of Rory never having to answer the door when a gentleman caller comes a knocking, and to make matters worse, she has to come face to face with her English teacher. When she lets him, she has play hostess for a few excruciating minutes.

Later, Lorelai and Rory have a skating date. Since her skates look old and dull, Luke offers to sharpen and tighten them. (Could Lorelai be any more clueless to Luke's obvious crush?) Rory suggest they invite Max, alerting Lorelai to the fact that her daughter's on a first name basis with her English teacher. Well, it's just for when they're outside of school (on Max's suggestion), but Lorelai doesn't seem to like it very much. Rory really approves of her mom's latest choice in men, but why doesn't Lorelai dig her daughter's enthusiasm?

Then when Sookie starts asking questions about Max, Lorelai does what she apparently always does at the two month mark. She bails on every relationship when it gets serious or when Rory starts to get attached. Lorelai denies her actions, but her defensiveness is a big sign that Sookie is right on the money. When Lorelai hits below the belt, though, saying that Sookie is hardly an expert on relationships since she hasn't had one in years, the conversation comes to a halt. Lorelai has gone from &quot;zero to jackass in a matter of seconds.&quot; She apologizes profusely but it is clear Sookie is hurt and totally bummed about her lack of prospects in the man department.

At Chilton, Max stops Rory in the halls to compliment her latest paper and asks if Lorelai is coming to parent's day. He's nervous about asking Rory anything about her mother but he hasn't heard from Lorelai in days.

Meanwhile, Rory's giving the latest Chilton dish to her mom, namely about Paris's folks' divorce and the fact that it's all over school. Rory feels bad, even though it's evil Paris who's going through the rumor mill. But the event is changing the whole dynamic at school, made clear by the fact that Madeline and Louise are saying hello to Rory. Then, when Rory brings up parent's night, Lorelai says she might not go. She's full of excuses (she has a &quot;thing&quot; at the Inn) until it seems to Rory that her mom is breaking up with Max. Lorelai won't say why and Rory is completely annoyed at her mom's immature behavior.

Feeling bad and guilty, Lorelai decides to go to parent's night. Once they are there, they spot Paris and her mom, who is berating her daughter about not using skin cleanser she got her daughter. Paris's mom bails on the night early, and Lorelai knows she's looking pretty good to Rory right about now. After they attend Max's class with the other students and parents, Lorelai stays behind to talk to him. Turns out, he's left four messages and wants to know exactly what's going on, then everything becomes crystal clear. He knows that he's being dumped, but he would expect a better dumping from Lorelai. She tries to explain how she feels, but he still doesn't get it. They argue and argue until he just kisses her and she kisses him back right there in the classroom. And guess who spots it all? Paris. And it's a matter of seconds before the juicy news spreads all over the school. Paris even dares to rub it in Rory's face.

When Lorelai comes to find Rory, she freaks out on her mom. Why would she do this? Lorelai apologizes again and again and says the whole reason she was going to breakup with Max in the first place was because she didn't want to hurt Rory. But Rory doesn't need to be protected so much anymore. Maybe it's time for the Gilmore rules to change.

The next Friday, Lorelai asks that Rory keep the whole incident quiet from Emily. But as soon as they get in the door, Rory is banished upstairs while Emily admonishes Lorelai for her kissing in the classroom. Emily knows everything, but Lorelai only says it was a mistake. And then it comes out that Lorelai is dating Rory's teacher. Emily becomes even more horrified as Lorelai tries to explain how she feels about Max. So, Emily wonders, was worth humiliating Rory for this man? Was he the &quot;one&quot;? With tears in her eyes, Lorelai says he might have been.

At school, Paris is being a witch, implying that Rory's going to get special treatment now that her mom is getting up close and personal with Max Medina. Rory can hardly believe her ears. She's quick to point out how hypocritical Paris is being, considering her laundry's been spread out for the whole school. Paris cops to her crime, admitting that she just wanted the school to talk about something else for a change. The two make a little peace, and Rory even offers to listen to Paris's problems. Neither will admit it, but the two might actually become friends.

When Lorelai and Max meet and talk about what happened, she reveals that it was really she who was scared about getting hurt. She apologizes for getting freaked out, but Max reveals that he is jeopardizing his career at Chilton. He could have been fired for what he did. Who knew it was going to be so complicated? Now, it's Max who's backing off. He doesn't know what to do, saying maybe they need to take a little time away from each other to figure out how to be together. And Lorelai's worst fear is being realized right there. They are breaking up. The guy who could've been the &quot;one&quot; walks out the door and out of Lorelai's life. When Rory gets home that night, she finds her mom in her bed, crying.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1378">'''Jason Stiles''' is [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]]'s business partner through [[Season 4]]. He also dated [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]], making him her last boyfriend before dating Luke. Jason initially teamed up with Richard in the hopes of trying to defeat his father's company. However, Jason later has a huge falling out with Richard after Jason's father, [[Floyd Stiles]], threatens to destroy Richard's business. Richard in turn makes a deal with Floyd that leaves Jason out in the cold. Jason ends up suing Richard, which prompts Lorelai to break up with him.

Jason is in a sense a male version of Lorelai. They both share a similar sense of humor, and he is very &quot;off center&quot;, as Lorelai once describes it to [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]].

We see Jason [[Raincoats and Recipes|one last time]] in the [[Dragonfly Inn]], trying to reconcile with Lorelai, which fails.

==Character Traits ==
Jason reveals to Lorelai in an episode that he is an extremely light sleeper and cannot sleep with anyone else, and Lorelai has to sleep in a guest room, which houses his &quot;distractions&quot; like films and books. He has a very strange dog which has the ability to stay remarkably still without moving and making any noises, which is what Jason loves about him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3117">[[Image:Chilton.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The real-life Chilton Prep—Greystone Mansion.]]
'''Chilton Preparatory School''' is a co-educational prep school catering for students from kindergarten to senior level that Rory attends from [[Season 1]] through [[Season 3]]. It is located in Hartford and is a prestigious school to attend, Rory gaining attendance there in her sophomore year. Its school colors are blue and white(silver), and the students attending Chilton are required to wear a uniform. For girls the uniform consists of blue and white kilt, blue blouse, navy blue tie and any combination of a sweater vest (blue or gray), sweater(blue) and blue blazer. Boys attending Chilton wear pale khaki pants, blue dress shirt and ties, and a blue blazer.

It has a student paper, The Franklin, of which both [[Paris Gellar]] and [[Rory Gilmore]] write for during their time at Chilton. Paris was the editor in her Junior year, when Rory was on the staff.

The Student council is made up of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, as well as student class presidents from the Senior, Junior and Sophomore levels. In their Senior year, Paris was the Student Body President and Rory was the Vice-President, leading to reformations in regards to the Library and Hem Lines.

Chilton is highly competitive, and, as [[Headmaster Charleston]] once put it, while failure is a part of life, it is not a part of Chilton. Most students attending Chilton end up at an Ivy league school.

The Chilton parents are expected to be highly involved in activities at Chilton, participating in things such as bake sales and fund-raising, through associations such as the Booster club. These clubs also have faculty representation.

Notable characters to arise from Chilton include Paris' friends [[Madeline Lynn]] and [[Louise Grant]] who both attended for a long time, and played active roles in The Franklin and Student Government, but were often too preoccupied with boys to study. [[Tristan DuGrey]] was the main love interest at Chilton, but was expelled during his Junior year after a number of indiscretions.

[[Max Medina]], Rory's English Lit teacher played a major role in both her success at Chilton and as one of [[Lorelai Gilmore]]'s fiance's whom she met at a parent teacher day at Chilton.

Rory also hosts a student from Chilton in her sophomore year at Yale.

Characters who attended Chilton are: Rory Gilmore, Paris Gellar, Tristen Dugray, Madeline Lynn, Louise Grant.
==Trivia==
*The marble floors in the lobby walked on by Harriet Beecher Stowe.
*Robert Frost donated the main staircase's banisters.
*Thomas Edison ceremonially lit a sconce.
*The school was opened on 1803, since it celebrated its bicentennial Rory's senior year.
*It can be assumed that tuition at the school is $25,000 per year, as Lorelai's $75,000 check paid her parents back in full.
*Tuition is comprable to that of a state university.
*Class sizes are small-Rory's senior class consisted of 45 students.
*Lorelai carved her and Rory's initials into a wooden column.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2635">'''[[File:Emily-kuroda-017.jpg|thumb]]Mrs. Kim''' is the mother of [[Lane Kim]], [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]'s best friend from [[Stars Hollow]]. She owns [[Kim's Antiques]], which is in her house. She is a follower of the Seventh Day Adventists, and her strict parenting of Lane forces her daughter into a double-life. She is portrayed as a very stern woman, who still speaks with a Korean accent (but with good English skills, even if she speaks mostly in short staccato sentences). Because of her Korean heritage and religious nature, she is suspicious of common American customs and lax attitudes, but she at time displays a surprising depth of understanding of their ways, as illustrated when she helps [[Zack Van Gerbig|Zack]] rewrite a pop song, or when she gets [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]]'s &quot;Knockers&quot; pun.

When she visits Lane's home she shares with her bandmates for the first time, she runs out out of shock.

It is learnt during Lane's wedding that Mrs. Kim, like Lane, has taken a different route than her mother in terms of lifestyles. While Mrs. Kim's mother is a Buddhist, she herself is a Christian, unknown to her mother. (just like how Lane secretly had a different lifestyle in the past while pretending to be a dedicated Christian) Also, it is revealed that Mrs. Kim only had sex once in her entire life, and was lucky to carry Lane. She seems to abhor the idea of engaging in sexual practices (calling it &quot;terrible things&quot;), even telling Lane that she just &quot;has to do it&quot; even if she doesn't want to because of a man's expectations.

Although Lane thought Mrs. Kim would be mad after she becomes unexpectedly pregnant, she is happy at the news of getting grandchildren and gives her blessing to both Lane and Zack.
==Trivia==
*She has never been alone with two boys.
*Salad water is kept in the Kim house as a soft drink substitute.
*She has a sister, Joon, with whom she is close in age. There's also a younger brother who is close in age to Lane. Joon has a daughter, Christine, which makes Mrs.Kim an aunt.
*When Lane went on her hockey date, she took a serious picture, claiming it was for the grandchildren. This is a common, if somewhat dated, practice in Korea.
*She used to be in a tambourine band when she was Lane's age.
*She keeps a bottle of alcohol hidden in her cabinet.
*Keeping secrets seems to run in the Kim family; the fact that she is Seventh Day Adventist is kept a secret from her Buddhist mother, and Lane kept most of her life from her mother.

'''Kirk Gleason''' is an eccentric character from [[Stars Hollow]], mostly known for his string of jobs/career paths, which change from episode to episode, and the exasperation he produces in diner-owner, [[Luke Danes]].

==Early On==
Kirk is portrayed by actor Sean Gunn, who has appeared as other characters on the show. In the [[Pilot|pilot episode]], Gunn plays [[Mick]], a DSL installer sent to Lorelai's home. He then plays &quot;Swan Guy&quot; in [[Kill Me Now|1.03]], a man who delivers swans to the [[Independence Inn]]. Gunn's first appearance as Kirk Gleason is in [[Cinnamon's Wake|1.05]], where he introduces himself as the new assistant manager of [[Doose's Market]]. He reprimands [[Miss Patty]] for eating fruit without paying, and she calls him &quot;Kirk the Jerk.&quot; However, in later episodes it is established that he grew up in [[Stars Hollow]], and Patty has known him since he was a child.

==Life==
Kirk lives with his [[Mrs. Gleason|mother]], who, although never actually seen on the show, is portrayed as overbearing, doing such things as not letting Kirk have a key. He raises money by doing a variety of odd jobs around [[Stars Hollow]], which range from helping [[Taylor Doose]] at town meetings to running &quot;Kirk's Diner&quot;, a replacement for [[Luke Danes|Luke]]'s when [[Luke's Diner]] was undergoing repairs. In season three's &quot;[[A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving]]&quot;, he adopts a cat, which he names Kirk. [[Cat Kirk]] loathes Human Kirk, and every time we see Kirk in the episode, he has acquired new injuries.

In season three's second episode, &quot;[[Haunted Leg]]&quot;, Kirk asks Lorelai out on a date, which starts his interest in girls. In the season four [[Raincoats and Recipes|finale]], he has a girlfriend, [[Lulu]], who he apparently loves. They are presumed to be together throughout the rest of the series.

He lives in the basement of his mother's home - which used to be a bomb shelter - and, with encouragement from Luke, attempts to move out in episodes [[Pulp Friction]] and [[To Live and Let Diorama]] of [[season 5]]. It is then that he attempts to buy the [[Twickham House]] out from under Luke's feet after Luke tells him he should move out to really start a life with Lulu. Eventually, the house is given to Luke, but he later backs out. In the 5.17 episode, &quot;Pulp Friction,&quot; Kirk is found wandering Stars Hollow after leaving his mother's house and he took up residency in Michel's motor home, Luke's unfinished boat, and a few other places. In &quot;To Live and Let Diorama&quot; it was said he was staying with a Stars Hollow family, but decided to move out because &quot;their kids stuck things in my nose!&quot; (while he wasn't asleep). For a short time in this episode, Kirk is seen staying with Lorelai at the Crap Shack (along with Paris and Rory, both of whom decided to come to Stars Hollow for a break). He is portrayed as extremely childish in this episode, building a fort out of cereal boxes because he felt he was being ignored by Paris and Rory, and being scolded by Lorelai for leaving the television on while they were eating breakfast.

'''Taylor Doose''' is the owner of [[Doose's Market]], and runs the town meetings. He has a fussy manner and frequently act as the foil to [[Luke Danes]]. He is the most politically powerful person in the small community of [[Stars Hollow]], and much of the humor of the character comes from his overblown self-importance, and his troublesome initiatives as town leader. Taylor is also a member of the [[Town Beautification Committee]]. He may have had a son, as evidenced by his surprised reaction after a policewoman mistook the newspaper vendor for his child.

He was the lead guitarist and singer in the band [[Lane]] joined, the band later named Hep Alien. He was later revealed to also be one of the main songwriters in Hep Alien, mostly writing songs about girls and naming them after girls.

After Dave leaves for California, the band remains together and get a new member, [[Gil]], who Zack initially does not like. Eventually, he, Lane, and Brian move into a rented house together. He and Brian sleep in bunked beds in the living room while Lane gets the bedroom. He and Brian reportedly eat anything, including lotion on potato chips. During his time living with Brian and Lane, Zack is revealed to be somewhat of a womanizer.

As time goes on, Lane develops feelings for Zack which she eventually find out are returned. Zack is revealed at this beginning stage to be very slow at processing major decisions. His womanizer ways are quickly ditched, however, as he begins a relationship with Lane and becomes her boyfriend, and later husband.

In the seventh season, Lane returns from their honeymoon pregnant with twins. While Zack continues to act a bit dim, he continues to be caring and dotes on an often highly annoyed pregnant Lane. Late in her pregnancy, he begins working at Luke's in Lane's place and reveals that he is very nervous about fatherhood. Eventually, he and Lane have their twin boys, Steve and Kwan.

Towards the end of season 7, Zack gets an offer to replace the guitarist on for an opening band on a tour. He insists as part of the job offer that he is able to bring Lane, Steve, and Kwan with him but Lane eventually decides that she can't manage two infants without her support system at home but tells Zack he needs to go as it has always been his aspiration to make a living with his music. Zack appears disappointed but still goes, despite not wanting to leave his wife and sons for that length of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">'''[[File:213264.jpg|thumb]]Liz Danes''' is the younger sister of [[Luke Danes]]. She was born and raised in Stars Hollow. Following her mother's death, Liz began to cut loose and get into trouble including smoking pot. She met Jimmy Mariano at a festival. The two married and Liz gave birth to a son [[Jess Mariano]]. Jimmy left her right after the birth of Jess and Liz began to a series of bad relationships, drug problems, had trouble keeping a job and was unsure of how to raise her son. At the beginning of season two, she sent her seventeen-year-old son to stay with her older and much more responsible brother Luke in their hometown of Stars Hollow. During this time Liz seemed to clean up her life. She stopped doing drugs and got a somewhat a sustainable job making jewelry in the Renaissance faire circuit.
She returns to Stars Hollow mid season four for her high school reunion and visits Luke along with her new boyfriend [[T.J.]]. Although Luke is initially skeptical that he current job and relationship are unstable like those of the past, he eventually sees that Liz has finally gotten her life together. During this trip, Liz meets Lorelai for the first time. Lorelai, needing her broken window to be repaired, runs up to the window of Luke's truck expecting to see Luke, but instead sees Liz. Initially, Liz assumes Lorelai is Luke's then-wife Nicole and claims that Lorelai seems like his type. Also during this trip, it is revealed that Liz and Jess have reestablished contact on a semi-regular basis. A few moths later, she and T.J. return to Stars Hollow again announcing that they will be having a Renaissance-themed wedding in the town square. Luke gets roped into helping out with a great deal of the wedding and brings Lorelai as a date, who conveneintly fixes Liz's dress when she accidentally tears it moments before the ceremony.

A few weeks following her wedding, Liz and T.J. were in some undefined accident causing each of them to break an arm and a leg. Luke came and helped them run their booth at the Renaissance Faire for seven weeks while they recovered, allowing her and her husband to become somewhat closer to her older brother. A couple of months later, Liz and T.J. arrive in Stars Hollow and announce that they are looking for a home in Stars Hollow to settle down in the off-season. Liz and T.J.'s crazy antics often irratate the generous and family-orientated Luke, over the next year, but Luke does seem glad that he gets to see them more often. near the end of the sixth season, Liz discovers that she is pregnant. Fearing that she will repeat the same mistakes with this child that she made when Jess was young, she lashes out on an innocent T.J. and kicks him out of the house. She tells Luke however that T.J. left her and she was going to raise the baby alone. Luke is angered by this and immediately goes to find T.J. with the intent to fight him, but discovers the truth from T.J. and eventually reconciles them. In the final season Liz has a home birth gives birth to a daughter named Doula, named out of appreciation for her Doula during her home delivery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2652">Food plays an important role in the show.  The leads, Rory and Lorelai, are notorious for eating large quantities of food, as well as creating rituals that also involve the eating of food.

==Lorelai and Rory==
Both have similar tastes, and voracious appetites.  Early on, it is established that they keep very little food in the house, and rely heavily on take out.  Both are addicted to coffee.
===Food consumed===
*Coffee - numerous instances
*Chili cheese fries ([[1.01]])
*Cheeseburgers ([[1.03]] and others)
*Tacos and burritos ([[1.09]])
*Apple tarts (refered to in [[1.10]])
*Chicken soup and pez (after being unable to locate coffee in the hospital) ([[1.10]])
*Pop tart appetizers (a stack of pop tarts with an apple)([[1.13]])

==Emily==
The grandmother, Emily, with her various duties as a high society figure, is very particular about food and its presentation at vaious events she hosts, as well as the meals served in her home.  She seems particularly enamoured with various dishes involving salmon.
===Food Served===
*Cake with chocolate frosting(seen in [[1.01]])
*Lobster puffs (reference in [[1.02]])
*Cassoulet ([[1.03]])
*&quot;Used&quot; blueberry shortcake ([[1.03]]) - Emily turns up her nose at Lorelai's gift of leftovers.
*Pudding because she knows Lorelai and Rory like it, but Lorelai says Emily thinks of pudding as hospital food only suitable for when you are having a vital organ removed ([[1.06]])
*Frozen pizza, eaten as a last resort since the cook is unavailable.  Emily refers to it as food you'd eat at a carnival or a Turkish prison. ([[1.08]])
*Smashed bananas on toast ([[1.09]]), which she gave Lorelai when she was sick when little.

==Luke Danes==
In the pilot, Luke seems to be a health nut, saying &quot;Red meat kills,&quot; when serving Lorelai her burger, and chastising Rory for eating chili cheese fries and drinking coffee (ep. [[1.01]]).  In later episodes, this character quirk seems to have been abandoned, and on a date, he severely dislikes the vegan dishes he is served.  Fitting for his personality, he apparently has simple tastes, and says that he has never had lobster before eating at Logan's Martha's Vineyard house.
===Food preferences===
*Peppermint tea over coffee ([[1.10]])
===Foods served===
*Santa burger ([[1.10]])

==Michel Gerard==
Finicky Michel follows a very strict no-carb diet.

==Sookie St. James==
Sookie is very adventurous and creative in preparing her food.  She is famous for her risotto.
===Food===
*Peach sauce ([[1.01]])
*Blueberry shortcake ([[1.03]])
*Kiwi ice cream (proposed, unknown if prepared) ([[1.03]])

==Others==
*Mrs. Kim is a vegetarian, apparently for religious reasons.</text>

&lt;h2&gt;Character Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Jess Mariano&lt;/b&gt; is the troubled love-interest of Rory Gilmore, son of Liz Danes,Jimmy Mariano and nephew of Luke Danes. He appears in Stars Hollow in Season 2 after Liz sends him to live with Luke, who is unprepared for caring for a troubled youth.
He develops a romantic interest in Rory, and his interest is reciprocated, but Rory is still with her first boyfriend Dean Forester. Although Rory never says it out loud, she feels like Jess and her are kindred spirits, sharing very similar interests. He knows her better than anyone. Jess, however, causes Rory to do a number of unlikely things such as skip school, miss Lorelai's Graduation and cheat on Dean by kissing Jess at Sookie's wedding. Dean eventually gets sick of being the obvious second fiddle and breaks up with Rory at the Dance Marathon after months of speculation by many people over the attraction, for which he is unfairly blamed. Rory and Jess have a tumultuous relationship, with Jess being less committed and reliable than Dean, which is frustrating for Rory.
Jess seemed excited about the prospect of Rory attending Yale and continuing their relationship while she's in college, however due to extreme number of absences, he eventually fails school, and leaves Stars Hollow for Venice Beach, California, where his estranged father, Jimmy Mariano lives.

This depature was unexpected, with Jess telling neither Luke nor Rory. He continues to call Rory while in California, never talking, but on her graduation day she tells him that she could have loved him, but wasn't going to pine.
Jess disappears for most of Season 4 but returns to the show to retrieve his car that Luke had taken and hid to prevent Jess from leaving town at the end of the previous season. After getting his car repaired, and several run ins with Rory (in which he was always the one to walk away first), Jess finally confronts her before he leaves town again, giving Rory his perfect parting line of &quot;I love you&quot; before turning and walking away, again.

Jess does not appear until the end of the season after Luke forcibly suggests that he come to his mother's wedding to T.J. It is here that Jess reads Luke's self help book and realizes that he has been treating Rory all wrong. He appears at her Yale dorm, and asks her to come away with him. This, however, is at the same time that Rory has been getting closer to her now married ex-boyfriend Dean. Jess tells her not to say no unless she doesn't want to be with him, and she declines. After this rejection, Jess leaves without another word; again.
Jess moves to Philadelphia where he joins a small publishing house,and writes a novel. He visits Rory while traveling to Hartford to talk to independent bookstores about carrying his book.

He goes to dinner with Rory and Logan Huntzberger, but leaves after Logan mocks him. He ends up confronting Rory about how she has been spending her life - dropping out of Yale, living at her grandparents' house, and joining the DAR. Their talk inspires Rory to move out of her grandparents' house and resume attending Yale. Several months later, Jess' publishing house has an open house, and he invites both Luke and Rory . Luke attends with April, and Jess meets his cousin for the first time. Rory attends alone, and she and Jess kiss, but Rory confesses that she is in love with Logan and that she came because she was angry that Logan cheated on her. Jess is angry at being used but tells her that she can tell Logan that something happened if it will make her feel better. It is worth noting that Rory cheated on both of her boyfriends, Dean and Logan, with Jess.
Jess has difficult relationships with his relatives. Originally resentful of being forced out of New York and to Stars Hollow, he begins to appreciate having a stabilizing influence in his life in Luke, eventually paying him back all the money that he owed and telling Luke how much he appreciates what Luke did for him. He also attends Liz's wedding to TJ and walks his mother down the aisle.
Milo Ventimiglia has stated that he was happy with the way that the character was left, and that he didn't need to come back during as hoped by the creators. At the end of the series, Jess is the only one of Rory's ex-boyfriends with whom she is on good terms.

She is quite similar to [[Lorelai]], in her musical and fashion tastes. Anna and Lorelai also share the quality of being fiercely protective over their daughters.  At first, she is agreeable to Luke being involved in April's life, but did not want Lorelai to have any part of April's life. Anna felt that because she was only Luke's fiancee, not something more &quot;permanent,&quot; such as Luke's wife, that the relationship was too unstable and was afraid April would be hurt if they broke up. Anna tried to cut Luke out of April's life when she (Anna) wanted to take April with her to move to New Mexico to take care of her sick mother. Luke reluctantly went to a lawyer - Jim - because he wanted to obtain partial custody of April. Jim represented Luke in a custody lawsuit against Anna; although Luke got discouraged when he was told that in this kind of legal battle, the mother usually wins. For the trial, Luke asked Lorelai to write a character reference letter for him, which ended up being what helped Luke win partial custody. The letter, also started the break up process between Lorelai and Christopher, and served as a confirmation of Lorelai's deep history and connection to Luke (which will gradually draw them close again). Anna did move to New Mexico with April, but April still visits Luke in Connecticut on her school vacations, and shares phone calls and updates with her father. Anna doesn't make any appearances on the show after the court date for the custody battle.&lt;/p&gt;

'''Marty''' is a friend of [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] that she met at [[Yale]]. Her first encounter with Marty was when she found him nude in the hallway of her dorm. In later episodes, he seemed to have romantic feelings toward Rory, but she was already interested in [[Logan Huntzberger|Logan]]. Later, after it is revealed that Marty is the boyfriend of [[Lucy]], Marty keeps his previous friendship with Rory a secret from Lucy, and Rory is forced to go along with it. Logan finally tells Lucy the truth and she breaks up with him.

[[Image:Hotel_independence2.jpg|250px|right]]The [[Independence Inn]] was the first Inn that [[Lorelai]] worked at as a teenaged mother. She started as a maid, and worked her way up to executive manager. In addition to Lorelai, the staff included the chef, [[Sookie]], and [[Michel Gerard]], who ran the desk. It was owned by [[Mia]] until the inn was severely damaged by a terrible fire. Afterwards, it was not reopened, leading Sookie and Lorelai to start a temporary catering business, eventually opening their own inn with Michel, the [[Dragonfly Inn]]. During its day, The Independence Inn hosted many events in its dining hall, such as fashion shows, weddings, the famous Bracebridge Dinner and the annual gathering of the [[Edgar Allen Poe Society]].

The '''Dragonfly Inn''' is the inn owned and operated by [[Sookie St. James]] and [[Lorelai Gilmore]], from season four until the end of the series (and presumably into the future). Sookie and Lorelai first discovered it in Season 1 through [[Luke]]'s ex-girlfriend [[Rachel]]. Rachel was a photographer and found the disheveled Dragonfly and showed Lorelai the pictures, sparking her interest in the old building.

==Ownership==
The inn was a preexisting inn owned by [[Fran Weston]], that had fallen into disrepair and was renovated after being purchased by Lorelai and Sookie. Fran initially refuses to sell the place, but she eventually dies and Lorelai and Sookie negotiate a deal at Fran's funeral with the family attorney.

==Trivia==
*The Inn was located on 3rd Street before the street names were changed in [[Stars Hollow]] in [[6.06]], after the street was called Sores and Boils Alley.
*It was first seen in [[Emily In Wonderland|1.19]] when [[Rachel]] takes Lorelai there to take pictures.
*The house used for the inn was the Walton's family home in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waltons The Waltons].

Christopher learns that Sherry is pregnant while at Sookie's wedding with Lorelai ([[I Can't Get Started|2.22]]). Christopher and Sherry had been having relationship problems, and he had planned[[File:49764_1202090228069_full.jpg|thumb|left]] to break up with her. However, when Sherry calls him to tell him she's pregnant, he decides to go back to her. Gigi is born during [[Dear Emily and Richard|Season 3]] in Episode 13. Her birth certifcate can been seen stating her birth taking place on January 31, 2003 at 1:17am, weigh 6 lbs and 20 oz. Her given name is listed as Georgia S. Tinsdale.

When Gigi is almost two, Sherry leaves Christopher and Gigi to take a job in Paris ([[Norman Mailer, I'm Pregnant!|5.06]]). Christopher spoils Gigi, and she is so bratty that Christopher can't keep a nanny or get Gigi into preschool. After Lorelai babysits Gigi, she confronts Christopher about his parenting. He takes Lorelai's advice, and Gigi becomes much better behaved ([[Bridesmaids Revisited|6.16]]).

During Season 7, Sherry apologizes to Christopher for leaving him and Gigi and says she wants to be part of her daughter's life again. Christopher and Lorelai accompany Gigi to Paris to visit Sherry ([[French Twist|7.07]]), and Gigi stays with her mother for several months. While in Paris, Christopher and Lorelai spontaneously get married. When Gigi returns from Paris, she lives in Stars Hollow in Lorelai's house, and Rory's bedroom becomes Gigi's room. After her father and Lorelai fight over a letter Lorelai wrote for Luke's custody battle, Gigi and Christopher stay at his mother's house. Christopher and Lorelai subsequently divorce; Gigi is occasionally referenced by her father and Lorelai, but she doesn't make any more appearances.

Paris and Doyle obviously meet through the newspaper, however they bond through a speed-dating session that [[Terrance]] had suggested Paris attend to help her cope with [[Asher Flemming|Asher]]'s death. ([[5.10]]) Doyle and Paris end up sleeping together that day. Their relationship has its ups and downs, but in general Doyle seems to be able to handle Paris' temper and survives in one piece. After one falling out, Doyle tries to kiss Rory, but she refuses. Doyle soon slumps back to Paris and they have a long term relationship beyond the end of the show.

Doyle and Paris live with each other after the relationship becomes serious. After a while, Paris invites Rory to join them.

Fran was the first person Lorelai met in [[Stars Hollow]]; she asked Fran for directions to the [[Independence Inn]], where Lorelai would eventually begin a job.  While Fran only appears in a few episodes of the series, she is mentioned often until her death at the end of the third season.

'''Lorelai &quot;Trix&quot; Gilmore née Gilmore''' was [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]]'s mother. She made frequent surprise visits to the [[The Gilmore House|Gilmore Mansion]], to the great horror of [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]], with whom she never got along. Interactions between the two are frequently riddled with snide comments from Trix towards Emily, which Emily suffers with growing contempt. Married her second cousin . she was born on May 4 , 1914

==Season one==
*Trix is first referenced in episode 3 of the series, in which Emily and Richard make it appear she is no longer living. She makes her first actual appearance in episode 18. Her dislike for Emily is heavily shown, as she criticizes her throughout much of the episode, while looking on her son, [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]], and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] with admiration and approval. When Lorelai reveals that she is borrowing money from her parents to pay for Rory's education, Trix offers to give Rory her trust fund. Emily then interferes, making Lorelai question this decision, claiming it may destroy the relationship she has with her daughter. After witnessing an argument between Emily and Lorelai, Trix withdraws this offer, calling the two women too immature, which she says Lorelai gets from Emily. She then leaves, and Emily and Rory reconcile.

==Season three==
*Trix reappears later in season 3 during Richard's 60th birthday. As her last visit, she wastes no time criticizing her daughter-in-law. Trix makes dinner arrangements at [[Independence Inn|Lorelai's inn]] after looking over her [[Lorelai's House|house]], of which she disapproves (only implied by her reaction, but she doesn't say anything to Lorelai about this). During the dinner, she announces she'll be moving back into her own home near the Gilmore Mansion, much to Emily's dismay. At this, Emily takes advice from Lorelai and uses her daughter's rebellious tactics to annoy her mother-in-law. In the [[I Solemnly Swear | following episode]], Emily mentions that Richard is helping her close down her house in London. In the episode [[Swan Song]], Emily talks about dealing with Gran after she and Richard have returned. She goes into state that Gran will be at Rory's graduation(which she is not), In the episode [[Face-Off]], she moves in with Richard and Emily and drives Emily crazy, even kicking her out her home so she can ready for a meeting. When Emily returns, she finds her making out with a man in a jogging suit. Lorelai tries to convince her not to reveal the secret, but after Trix insults her again, Emily, as Lorelai tells Richard later that same evening &quot;snaps&quot; and uses the information to humiliate her in front of her son and friends. Emily later, for the first time in over 35 years, has a heart to heart with Trix, and Trix decides she and Emily must have tea, but this doesn't effect their future relationship. Lorelai convinces Richard to, for the first time, not take sides with his mother, who, as Lorelai states tend to be fairly rough on Emily, while she always dotes on her, Rory, and Richard.

==Season four==
*Trix's last appearance is in season 4, episode 14. She visits and makes fun of Emily as usual, blaming her for Lorelai's hair not being done, as well as other things. While waiting for dinner, she asks Lorelai about her business, in which she immediate learns that Lorelai is having financial difficulty. Her anger then turns on Richard, who blames her son for his daughter being a &quot;failure&quot;. She brings up his past mistakes, and Richard finally stands up to his judgmental mother, much to the amusement of Emily and a depressed Lorelai. Trix departs on bad terms with her family.

==Death==
*In Episode 16 of Season 4, 2 episodes after her fight with her son, the family receives word that she died of a heart attack (which Richard suffers through twice in the series) in her own home, keeping the information a secret. While making funeral arrangements, Emily finds a letter from Trix to Richard, in which she begs him to not marry her. Realizing that Trix had never wanted her to even become a member of the Gilmore family, Emily breaks entirely, as she starts smoking and even reads a vivid novel, shocking both Lorelai and [[Sookie St. James|Sookie]] when they come to visit. Lorelai then takes over making the arrangements, and has a meltdown of her own during the process, but manages to get everything done with help from Rory. During the preparations, Lorelai and Rory also learn that Trix married her second cousin, Charles Abbot Gilmore, Richard's deceased father. We learn that Trix is 86 at the time of her death, meaning she was around 26 when Richard was born(as he is sixty going on sixty-one during this time). It's revealed from her niece, Marilyn, that she was very fond of Lorelai, and often showed off her picture, as well as prided herself on her granddaughter's independence as a single woman(this fact could explain her disapproval of Emily, who went straight from her parent's to Richard's, and never really worked at a profession).

==After season four==
*After her death, Trix is rarely mentioned or referenced in any episodes. Richard mentions Rory receiving her trust fund in season 6 when she's 21, which his mother set up for her in her first visit. Also, she is trivially referenced again in season 6, when Lorelai argues with Taylor during a town meeting about how many Lorelais he knows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1978">[[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] and [[Richard Gilmore]] live in a large '''house''' in Hartford, Connecticut. This is the home in which [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] grew up. She lived there until the age of 16 as she got pregnant by her boyfriend [[Christopher Hayden]]. Soon after she left with her baby ([[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]) and got a job at the [[Independence Inn]] as a maid (where she later became manager).

The Gilmore House is a very large house which also has a Pool House where Rory lived when her and Lorelai argue about Rory leaving Yale and also where Richard lives when Emily and Richard split up. This doesn't last long.

Lorelai often jokes about escaping from this house and enjoys telling people stories about it.

Often the Gilmore house is shown as the Greystone Mansion. But it can't be the Gilmore house. At the entrance at Greystone Mansion are stairs but in the series there aren't stairs at the enterance. And the windows in the Greystone mansion, and the windows in the Gilmore house do not agree.

The Gilmore house was build in 1907 by a student of Stanford White, the famed architect.

The ground floor consist of one dining room, a big corridor, one lounge, two living rooms, a kitchen, a small bath room and Richard's office. There is a big garden on the mansion with lots of plants. In front of the main house is no grass and only pavement, but the area around the poolhouse is grassy. The poolhouse consists of a kitchen, one living room, one bedroom and a bathroom. The main house has a basement that is mainly used as a storeroom. There is at least one floor and one attic in the Gilmore house but it is very seldom shown in the series. At any rate there are is at least bedroom (Richard and Emily's bedroom) with a very huge walk-in closet, one second bedroom (maybe for guests. Rory slept there once as the poolhouse was cluttered with furniture), two bathrooms and one dressing room in the first floor.

'''Lindsay Anne Lister''' was [[Dean Forester|Dean]]'s girlfriend after [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] and eventually became his wife.

==History==
===Early Years===
Bought [[Rory]] a magnet shaped like Mark Twain's head during their 4th Grade field trip to Mark Twain's House.
===Season 4===
Lindsay's family is very helpful to the young couple in their first few months of marriage. In episode 15 from [[Season 4]] ([[Scene in a Mall]]) Dean tells [[Luke Danes|Luke]] that Lindsay's mom Theresa comes over to help clean up after dinner and Lindsay's father Thomas frequently does house repairs. Lindsay's mother also spends time teaching Lindsay how to cook, although it is seemingly unsuccessful. Lindsay is a self-proclaimed bad cook but she still tries, even going so far as to make roast beef for Dean twice (Episode 5.1) because it didn't come out right the first time. She is so excited when it does work the second time that she jumps up and down, startling Dean who is carving the meat.

The marriage went well for a while, but found an abrupt end after Dean slept with [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] at the end of [[Season 4]]. Lindsay found out by finding a letter in Dean's pocket that Rory wrote to him about their night together. After reading the letter, Lindsay throws all of Dean's stuff out the window and tells him to move out.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="573">'''Rune''' (portrayed by Max Perlich) is [[Jackson Belleville]]'s rather unpleasant and quirky cousin. We get to know him when Jackson and [[Sookie St. James|Sookie]] go on their first date, which is actually a double date with Rune and [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] because Jackson finds it difficult to get rid of Rune for the evening. Lorelai agrees to this, but regrets this decision upon encountering Rune for the first time.

==Summary==
[[Lane]], convinced that [[Dean]]'s best friend is the boy for her, convinces [[Rory]] to double date with her. [[Lorelai]] reluctantly accepts a double and blind date with [[Jackson]], [[Sookie]], and Jackson's cousin, [[Rune]]. 

==Plot ==
Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match. Lane has convinced herself that she is totally perfect for Dean's friend Todd. As for her previous soul-mate (remember the guy in jazz band), he's done with, and it's now up to Rory to set the two up. The plan is that Rory will talk to Dean, who will talk to Todd, and voila! They'll have a perfect double date. Or will they?

Over at the inn, Lorelai is so overwhelmed with work (she's trying to get her MBA) that she accidentally overbooks the place. Michel, is not pleased, but what else is new? Back in the kitchen, Jackson (the produce guy) and Sookie are having a super awkward moment. (Remember when she asked him to go out sometime?) They speak on proverbial eggshells, and Lorelai can see exactly what's going on. Even though, Sookie is a nervous wreck, Lorelai convinces her to take the bull by the horns and ask Jackson out on a definite date. So Sookie dials his cell digits and does the deed. It looks like love is in the air.

After school, Rory meets Dean, who seems to have a one-track mind. All he wants to do is putt his lips on hers (not that there's anything wrong with that), but Rory has got other things on her mind. Namely that she wants Dean's help in setting up Todd and Lane. Dean seems kind of hesitant (he says maybe Todd won't like Lane), which totally offends Rory. Lane is Rory's best bud, and Todd would be lucky to have Lane. Dean knows an indignant girl friend when he sees one, so he agrees to the master plan, partly so he and Rory can get back to the smooching at hand.

When Sookie comes in to announce date with Jackson is a go, she mentions that there's one little problem. Jackson's cousin is in town this weekend, so Sookie volunteered Lorelai to be his date. After all, what are best friends for?

So now we've got two double dates on our hands. When the big day comes, Lane reveals that she's lied to her super-strict mom about her plans. Rory's not really down with lying to Lorelai, but the two girls devise a plan that, they hope, keeps them out of trouble. On their way out, Rory tells Lorelai that she and Lane are meeting Dean at the movies. They conveniently leave Todd out of the equation, hoping it will get Lane off the hook with her mom while avoiding an all-out lie to Lorelai.

After much primping, Sookie is finally ready for her night out. But when Jackson arrives, his cousin (who is named Roon) is a total weirdo who thinks Lorelai is so tall that she could qualify for a circus freak. He and Jackson have a conversation that is totally overheard by Lorelai and Sookie, which makes for an ultra-awkward start to the evening. At the restaurant, bad goes to worse so Lorelai just orders an endless supply of martinis.

As for Lane, her date isn't going so well either. Todd just isn't interested in anything she has to say. She rattles on and on about her musical tastes but all he can say is, &quot;Whatever.&quot; He's a major space cadet, clearly mismatched with smart, charming, cut-as-a-button Lane. How could this guy be a bud of Dean's? Clarification: they work on their bikes together and Todd's got the cool tools.

Back at the swanky restaurant, Sookie is so nervous that she virtually ignores Jackson, while Roon is just downright rude. Lorelai suggest they bail on the place and head to Luke's for burgers. This change of place works for Sookie and Jackson, who relax in the low-key joint. Lorelai ignores Roon, opting to flirt and play five-card draw with Luke. After a few minutes, Roon leaves, leaving Sookie and Jackson to officially hit it off, and Luke and Lorelai to continue their covert flirtation. Then, just when Luke looks like he might ask Lorelai out, Lane's mom bursts in and demands to know where the girls are. She's called the Gilmore house but there is no answer and now she finds Lorelai at the diner. There's nothing else for Lorelai to do but leave with Mrs. Kim to fetch the girls because, according to Lane's Mom, if they're alone with boys for another second, who knows what will happen.

Post movie, Lane is ready to make like a tree and leave (much to Todd's dismay, surprisingly). But Mrs. Kim arrives to deliver humiliation galore, dragging Lane home for some big-time lecturing. Lorelai is pissed too; she doesn't like being lied to. Rory is forced to bail on Dean, but Lorelai ultimately forgives her because she only lied to save Lorelai from lying to Mrs. Kim. Either way, they both have to respect Lane's Mom's wishes, no matter how crazy she is.

Days later, Rory sneaks up to Lane's window for a chat only to find that Lane is housebound indefinitely. Lorelai makes a visit to the antique shop on Lane's behalf and tries to make peace with Mrs. Kim. It isn't easy, and lots of insults are thrown Lorelai's way, but she does manage to make a small difference. Which is evidenced later when Rory and Lorelai meet a Luke's. Rory gets a page from Lane, which means she can talk on the phone and leave the house as far as the driveway. (It's a start.) While Lorelai hangs alone, waiting for Rory to return, Luke brings over some coffee and then he swallows hard and, and does nothing. Bummer. But he does get up some gumption and says maybe they could, you know, play cards again sometime. Lorelai would like that.

==Summary==
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19.1875px;&quot;&gt;[[Rory]] attempts to overcome her sorrow of losing [[Dean]] by not wallowing and getting up early on a Saturday morning and keeping her brain busy off the subject. She buys things and she goes to a party and takes [[Lane]] with her. At the party she kisses [[Tristan]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19.1875px;&quot;&gt; and then comes home and starts to wallow. [[Lorelai]] and [[Max]] share a one-night relapse, and decide to start &quot;talking&quot;. &lt;/span&gt;

==Plot ==
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;After last week's tragic event, the premature breakup of Rory and Dean three months after they started dating, we find Rory right where we left her. Inside her house, in shell shock. And who can blame her? She just lost her boyfriend and surely it's only a matter of time before the whole town will be buzzing from the news. As for Lorelai, she just can't believe it. After all, Dean did called Rory about 25 times a day. He was practically a stalker for Christ's sake! So, what gives? As Lorelai presses for details, Rory just walks into a room and begins to methodically box up everything Dean ever gave her, touched, or even looked at. And she wants to burn it all. Lorelai grabs the box and agrees to dispose of it; however, instead of watching it go up in flames, she secretly hides it in a closet 'cause she knows that Rory will want those things back one day, even if she doesn't realize it right now. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;At 6 am the next day, Rory wakes up bright and early and promptly throws herself into denial. (Which means she's totally energetic and is not at all willing to wallow in her misery.) Lorelai's totally suspicious of her daughter's behavior, not to mention annoyed at being woken up so early and confronted with a list of activities (including getting manicures and checking out the local elementary school's production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf among other random events) that will surely occupy the whole day. Lorelai reluctantly drags herself out of bed only to find that Rory has rearranged the furniture. Knowing this is a bad sign; Lorelai becomes extremely nervous and worried. Rory's refusal to grieve will surely come crashing down on her at some point, and then what? Lorelai begs Rory to wallow. At least sit in the dark and watch a sad movie and have a really long cry, but Rory flat out refuses to be that kind of girl, you know, the one who falls apart when she doesn't have a boyfriend. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;So instead, the Gilmore girls head into town and start the agenda, but of course they must strategically plan their route in order to avoid any and all possible places where Dean might be, including, Luke's. But how can Lorelai possibly endure a day without coffee, the elixir of the Gods? Inconceivable! So, the two make their way through the back alleys of Stars Hollow to get to the diner, which is filled to capacity with the 6 am crowd (people Lorelai have never seen in her life). They spot Rachel, serving coffee and learn that she's staying around for a while. Lorelai hides her dismay and snags a table with Rory, who feels like everyone there is staring at her. Like everyone knows. Knows that she's been dumped. Lorelai tries to deny it but Rory is right. Everyone does know. And Lorelai isn't helping. In fact, when she heads to the counter to put in a special order with Luke (chocolate chip pancakes with extra chocolate), he gets the scoop and he's furious. He didn't trust Dean as far as he could throw him. And before Lorelai can get back to the table, another Stars Hollow resident is telling Rory that he didn't like Dean either, calling him a floppy-haired jerk. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Amid all this chaos, Rory continues to claim that she is just fine but she's got that look, the look of someone who's been dumped. The same look Lorelai had on her face when Max dumped her. As they discuss how long it takes to get over a breakup, Luke spots the offender in question. Dean. And he's heading toward the diner. The nerve of that floppy-haired jerk! Luke flies into action, runs outside, and says: &quot;turn around bag boy,&quot; -- 'cause Dean ain't welcome here no more. Dean doesn't take him that seriously, which serves to turn their little pissing contest into a hilarious wrestling match. Lorelai and Rory run outside to break it up, and while Lorelai reprimands Luke, Rory and Dean have a moment alone. But nothing much happens because Dean just walks away after mumbling a few words. When all is said and done, the only thing to do is hit that list of activities on their agenda. First up, buying a soap dish for the kitchen. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Back at home, Babette, their crazy neighbor, busts in and wants to console Rory, but Lorelai cuts her off at the pass and tells her to go home. Although, Rory over hears some of the conversation and collapses on her bed in tears. She opens a schoolbook to stave them off, but then a piece of paper falls out of the book, and Rory finds an invite to a party being thrown by Madeline. And Rory decides to go to a Chilton party, even though the idea of doing such a thing would normally disgust her. She asks Lane to go too just in case the bash is a bust. Later that night, Lane comes over and says she saw Dean, who crossed the street when he spotted Lane. And if it's any consolation, he looked really sad. Rory takes this info in and then blows it off. She's going to a party and that's final, despite the fact that Lane has offered to stay in and help her best bud wallow. Before they leave, though, Rory spots the box of cornstarch, the one that she was holding the first time Dean kissed her. Lorelai grabs it and promises to throw it away but just puts in the box with the other stuff. And then Lorelai spots a box of stuff that she herself hid away, stuff from Max. Next thing you know, she's over at Sookie's place asking for a favor. She needs a car (Rory's got Lorelai's wheels) so that she can make a very bold move. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;In the next scene, Lorelai is knocking on Max's door. When he answers, she begins babbling about Rory and Dean breaking up and winds up saying that she really misses him. He hesitates for a second before he invites her in. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Over at the Chilton party, it's totally swank and packed. Madeline's house is so big, the place needs a map. When Rory finds the Chilton duo, Madeline and Louise want to know where Dean is. Before Rory is forced to explain, Lane changes the subject by introducing herself. Then, the Chilton girls leave to knock boots with their boyfriends, and Paris is left standing with Rory and Lane. Paris is her usual bitter self until the three of them spot Tristan and his main squeeze, Summer, having a nasty fight. Apparently, Summer was locked in the bathroom with some other guy and can't be bothered with explanations. Things start heating up for Lane too when the only Korean guy at the party spots her and drags her to the dance floor. Now, Rory finds herself solo. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, Max and Lorelai have their hands all over each other. It's crazy, but they can't stop, but they have to stop. They need to talk about it, calmly. Their conversation turns to their relationship or lack thereof, and find that nothing has changed. Lorelai is still Rory's mom and Max is still Rory's teacher. So, Lorelai coming there was a bad idea. Maybe. Either way, they wind up between the sheets. But what happens now? Lorelai doesn't want to leave and pretend it never happened, but there seems to be no other solution. Max suggests talking on the phone on a regular basis in order to figure it out. He wants to solve this conundrum and the only way to do that is to talk. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;While Lane actually has a good time, slow dancing with Henry, her Korean boy, Rory sits and reads a book until Tristan and Summer interrupt her private time with another fight. And then she dumps him right in front of everyone, including Rory. Ouch. Lane returns from the dance floor and has a mini-breakdown because she's actually falling for a guy her folks would approve of. It's her worst nightmare! But she can't stay away, once again leaving Rory all by herself. Rory wanders around and finds Tristan in the piano room, playing solo. She makes small talk about school until Tristan accuses Rory of enjoying the scene, loving every minute of Tristan being dumped. Rory denies it; she's got real sympathy and tells Tristan that Dean dumped her. Tristan surprises us all when he sincerely calls Dean an idiot. Rory returns the favor, prompting Tristan to apologize for giving Rory such a hard time for a while. She accepts the apology and then accepts a kiss on the lips from him. But it's only for a second because Rory bursts into tears and bolts, dragging Lane out with her. Back at home; Lorelai comes in to find Rory on the couch, ready to wallow. &lt;/span&gt;

==Summary==
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19.1875px;&quot;&gt;[[Richard]]'s mother, the first Lorelai, with much-too-much attitude visits, sending [[Emily]] into peril due to her disapproval of [[Emily]]. To make matters worse, she makes [[Lorelai]] an offer that may free her of her parents forever and upsets Emily. [[Paris]] and [[Tristan]] go out on a date after [[Rory]] suggested Tristan ask her out. &lt;/span&gt;

==Plot ==
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Emily, Lorelai, and Rory are having Friday night dinner and find they have little to talk about when Richard comes in late and announces that his mother, Lorelai I, is coming to visit from London. Rory is psyched to meet her great-grandmother; however, Emily seems a little tense. And when she finds out her mother-in-law will arrive in one week, she quickly excuses herself from the dinner table. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Lorelai soon finds Emily unpacking everything Lorelai I has ever given them. Thirty-five years of &quot;stuff&quot; that now must be put on display. Lorelai suggests that maybe Lorelai I won't notice if the gifts are missing. But Emily stresses that this woman notices everything. And her visit is sure to make Emily absolutely crazy. On the way home, Rory asks for some info. on the great Lorelai I, but Lorelai admits she knows very little about her own grandmother. She moved to London when her husband died and Lorelai never got to accompany Emily and Richard on their visits across the Atlantic. So, this will be a voyage of discovery for both of the Gilmore girls. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;At Chilton, Paris is heading up a study group about government, and as she assigns roles to classmates in their own mock government, she tries to make Rory and Tristan the queen and king. They both back down (clearly, they're feeling awkward about that kiss), so Madeline volunteers to be queen while Louise announces that she will be the lady in waiting. However, Paris is quick to point out that lady in waiting is not a political position. Paris is about to go into a certified tizzy fit because she's the only one taking this assignment seriously. Everyone agrees to stop clowning around but they're all bummed when Paris announces they all must work over the weekend to get everything done. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;After class, Paris wants the scoop on Rory and Tristan. She can sense some tension but Rory denies it up and down. When Rory realizes she forgot her notebook in class, she runs right back into class and right into Tristan. They share more awkwardness until Rory (clearly the bigger person here) suggests they talk about what happened. After all, they have to work on this government project together, not to mention share classes for the next two and half years, so they really should hash out some stuff. Tristan agrees. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;After a brief conversation, Rory and Tristan decide that the kiss didn't mean anything. But Rory admits the kiss was nice, even if she did start crying right after. See, the kiss didn't make her cry; Rory was just confused after her breakup with Dean. Tristan jokingly asks her if she wants to try it again before announcing that he's swearing off girls for a while. Rory has a really hard time believing that one! She tells him that instead of swearing off all girls, he should swear off a type of girl. Meaning, Tristan should go after a girl with ambition and intelligence, like…Paris. Tristan has a hard time picturing Paris as his girlfriend. After all, she's got major baggage. Rory, however, convinces him to think about it. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Meanwhile Lorelai is busy trying to fix a computer glitch at the Inn when Emily calls in a panic because she needs the hat rack back, namely the hat rack that she gave Lorelai long ago for Christmas. She needs it back because Lorelai I gave it to Emily. Did Emily really give a used present to her own daughter? &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;That Friday, Lorelai is actually looking forward to dinner, prompting Rory to call her mother mean. After all, Lorelai really just wants to see Emily squirm. Lorelai denies it, but Rory makes her mom promise that she won't outwardly revel in Emily's pain. Fat chance! When they arrive, Rory and Lorelai are dragging the hat rack with them. They put it in place before Lorelai I can see that it was missing. Emily, of course, is a total wreck, and the evening has only just begun. Introductions are made and then Lorelai I inspects them closely while Emily runs around trying to please Trix (Richard's pet name for his mother). Turns out, even though Trix is displeased with the scandal surrounding Lorelai's life, she does appreciate self-sufficiency and hard work, two things that are abundant in Lorelai and Rory's lives. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;As the night wears on, Emily just can't do anything right according to Trix. She insults the dinner as well as Rory's choice of future education, i.e. Harvard. How can she go to Harvard when Richard is a Yale man? Then, she inquires on how Lorelai is paying for Chilton. Can you say awkward? Lorelai insists she's paying back every borrowed cent, but it doesn't matter, Trix has heard enough and she's had enough of Emily's lousy dinner too. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;In the morning, the Chilton students gather for their government meeting. Rory brings java and donuts for everyone. While they discuss their mock society, Tristan walks in and asks for some private time with Paris. They take a moment in the hall and then return to the group. At Louise and Madeline's prodding, Paris reveals that Tristan asked her out. The girls can hardly believe it and they are so jealous. Since Paris is not Tristan's type at all, the girls offer to make her over like Sandy in Grease. Paris passes on the makeover, somewhat insulted by her buds' implication. Rory, on the other hand, tries to be nice and encouraging and tells Paris she's going have a great time. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Later, Lorelai goes to dinner alone because Rory has too much schoolwork to do. While she sits and studies, Paris comes knocking on the door in a total panic. She has nothing to wear and only one lipstick and it's barely even a color. Help! Rory invites her in but finds that Paris it's really true. The girl has absolutely nothing swank to wear. So Rory goes into Lorelai's closet for something sweet. Paris is so nervous; she's never done this dating thing, you can't put it on your college transcripts so what's the point? And why did Tristan ask her out anyway? Rory is super cool when it comes to calming Paris, telling her when she first met Dean, she was all butterflies but after a few dates it got easier. Then, Rory finds the perfect outfit and promises to find a lipstick with actual color. When it's all said and done, Paris looks amazing. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Over at dinner, Trix talks money with Lorelai. In light of Lorelai borrowing money for Chilton, Trix decides that loaning money is a dirty business. So, Trix has decided to set up a trust fund for Rory and arrange it so that Rory can access the cash now so she can use it to pay for Chilton. Wow! Lorelai is blown away. While Richard helps his mom upstairs to bed, Emily walks Lorelai out and abruptly tells her that Rory just cannot accept the trust fund. It will ruin Lorelai's relationship with Rory. Think about it. If Rory has the money, she won't need her mother anymore. Lorelai thinks it's all gibber-jabber until Emily hits a nerve. With all that cash, why would Rory backpack across Europe with her mom when she could go alone or take a friend or a boyfriend? Despite hitting that nerve, Lorelai leaves without giving Emily the satisfaction that she might be the tiniest bit right. Could she be right? &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;The next day, Lorelai gives Sookie the news but reluctantly admits that Rory still doesn't know about the trust fund. Lorelai gives Sookie the lowdown on the Emily speech. And what if the money does change their relationship? Cyndi Lauper said money changes everything and maybe that's true. Sookie assures Lorelai that it's all going be okay. This is just Emily's way of keeping control over Lorelai. The only thing to do is tell Rory what's going on and tell Emily to keep her trap shut. Easier said than done. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;As they speak, Emily is ranting and raving to Richard about the havoc his mother has brought to their house. Ultimately, the real reason Emily is upset is because if Lorelai gets that money, she'll never come visit again. Why would she have to? So everything Emily was saying about Rory, she really meant it to be directed at Lorelai. It is Lorelai who won't need Emily anymore and that is just too difficult to deal with. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;On Sunday morning, Paris arrives at school to finish the project and tells Rory that the date went really, really well. In fact, she can't stop smiling. But when Tristan arrives, and Paris tells him what a great time she had, he bursts her bubble by saying they should go out again, as friends. Oh the humanity! Paris doesn't agree but pretends that she and Tristan did indeed lack chemistry to save face. When she hears that Rory was behind the whole sordid thing, Paris goes off on her right in front of everyone. She can't stand the thought of being a charity case and blames Rory for her humiliation. Rory then admonishes Tristan for spilling the beans and then not really trying with Paris. But he claims it's better not to string Paris along, especially when he likes someone else. And who might that someone be? Rory thinks it means Tristan isn't over Summer yet, but that is not the case. Tristan likes Rory. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;At tea that afternoon, Lorelai meets Emily and Trix. While Trix is in the ladies room, Emily and Lorelai have a moment alone to talk. Lorelai admits that she didn't tell Rory about the money, making Emily believe something she said made an impact. But that's not the case at all. Why does Emily have to take something good and twist it around so much that it seems bad and nasty? This money is a good thing. And just to prove it, Lorelai takes out her cell and promises to call Rory right then and there. Emily stops her. Mother and daughter start fighting in the restaurant but get interrupted by Trix, who arrives from the bathroom. She scolds them for fighting and then takes back her offer for the trust fund. Clearly, Lorelai isn't mature enough to handle such a large responsibility. Rory had this fabulous opportunity, and Emily ruined it. Emily feels so bad that she sincerely apologizes and promises to fix it. There's no need to, though. Lorelai is taken aback by Emily's sincerity and says it's all good, really. Just as long as Lorelai doesn't have to take back the coat rack. &lt;/span&gt;

==Summary==
[[Lorelai]], [[Sookie]], [[Rory]], and [[Lane]] plan to attend the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bangles The Bangles] concert, but when Lane's mother finds out the truth, she bans her from going. Lorelai and Sookie offer up the three tickets so Rory can take [[Madeline]], [[Louise]], and [[Paris]] which backfires when Madeline and Louise take off with two mysterious boys for a party. Lorelai learns about [[Luke]]'s ex-girlfriend [[Rachel]] from a long time ago. 
==Plot ==
The show begins as Rory and Lorelai are going through Lorelai's closet with the intention of finding clothes to donate to a charity clothing drive. The problem is that Lorelai refuses to uproot her happy family of clothing, even if she is the one who helped to organize and run the whole event. It's up to Rory to take charge, use a little tough love, and grab a bunch of really old embarrassing clothes and donate them despite Lorelai's protests.

Later, Rory and Lane sort through the clothes when Luke arrives to donate some of his old goods. He bails quickly, leaving the girls to make sense of all the junk. When Lorelai spots a totally great piece of clothing, a sweatshirt with rhinestones, she insists on snagging it for herself. Rory reluctantly agrees because she thinks it will just be donated all over again next year. Next, Sookie busts into the Gilmore house all excited because she's four tickets to the Bangles concert on Saturday, making these four girls very happy.

At Chilton, Rory is getting the eye from Tristan in English class, but he is quickly busted by Ms. Caldecott, the English Teacher, for not paying attention. Even after his scolding, he can't take his eyes off of Miss Gilmore. When Ms. Caldecott assigns teams for a debate, she lumps Rory in with her worst enemies, Madeline, Paris, and Louise. The three amigos are not pleased, but they've got to find a place to work, so they agree to prepare at Rory's house on Saturday afternoon. Because Rory lives 30 minutes away and because the girls flat out refuse to take a bus, Paris agrees to drive. Just then, Tristan approaches and gets up close and personal with Paris, working his mojo and totally ignoring Rory.

After school, Lane and Rory must figure out a way to get Mrs. Kim to let her daughter attend the concert. Thing is, they can't mention the words &quot;show&quot; or &quot;concert.&quot; So Lane decides the best thing to do is say they're going to a play. Not quite the truth, but not a really big lie either. Lane stumbles through her request and doesn't get a definite answer. Things aren't looking good for Lane going to the concert.

At Luke's, Rory is surprised to see that he's hung a poster up on his restaurant about the rummage sale. Usually, he'd refuse such a gesture, but we all know why he's got a soft spot. When Lorelai comes in she's not only sporting the rhinestone jacket, but there's a hideous leopard print cowboy hat on her head. Rory is a little concerned; her mom has got to stop buying other people's clothes. When Luke spots Lorelai, he suddenly -- and without explanation -- totally freaks out over the jacket. He refuses to explain his outburst, leaving Lorelai and Rory completely confused.

Outside the Gilmore house, Lorelai has a sign that reads &quot;Rummage sale drop off here: Nothing alive or gross.&quot; At this point, the house is overrun with donations, making Lorelai rethink her charitable tendencies. Especially when Miss Patty arrives with some drums appropriate for a marching band. (Patty danced on them in the Copacabana in 1969.) Anyhow, Lorelai isn't impressed or interested. Inside, Patty spots the rhinestone jacket, and the mystery is solved. It once belonged to Luke's ex-girlfriend, Rachel. She broke his heart five years ago. How exactly did this juicy tidbit of information get past Lorelai? She was busy being a single mom. Wow, Luke had a girlfriend and Lorelai looks intrigued. No wonder Luke was so mad seeing her in the jacket.

When the three amigos arrive to study, the girls have little to say and stand gawking at Rory's digs. They set up shop in the living room; Louise can't keep her hands off all of the clothing, Madeline keeps asking Rory about Dean, and Paris just wants to get down to business.

Lorelai is now digging for dirt about Luke and his ex-girlfriend. Sookie tells her that Rachel was an amazing and adventurous girl and Luke was crazy about her. Unfortunately, Rachel thought Stars Hollow was too small and Luke on the other hand, would never leave the town.

Like a dictator in training, Paris is busy giving orders, but Rory strays from the subject at hand to tell Madeline and Louise about the Bangles concert. The two girls can hardly believe Rory would go to a concert with her mom; they clearly are not that close with their own respective mothers. Madeline is just fascinated; it's almost like having a big sister. Paris is now going out of her mind because no work is getting done at all. Rory bails for a second to give Lorelai an update on the situation. Maybe this means Rory is making friends, with Madeline and Louise at least. So when they find out that Lane actually told her mom the truth (which means she can't go to the concert), Lorelai suggest that Rory take all four Bangles tickets and take the girls. Lorelai and Sookie can always buy cheap tickets at the show. When Lorelai invites the girls to the concert, Madeline and Louise are super psyched, but they both have to force Paris to go.

When they arrive at the stadium where the Bangles will be playing, the girls take their awesome seats while Sookie and Lorelai go to the nosebleed section. Madeline and Louise are stoked when they find some hot college guys right behind them. (Let the flirting begin.) The Bangles take the stage and open with their first hit ever, &quot;A Hero Takes a Fall.&quot; Madeline and Louise aren't even watching; they have their backs to the band, a fact that makes Paris and Rory smile.

While the band sings &quot;Eternal Flame,&quot; Lorelai wants to know if Rachel is pretty. And, if yes, what kind of pretty? A Catherine Zeta-Jones pretty? A Michelle Pfieffer pretty? No. Sookie reports that she was an Elle McPherson pretty. Wow, Lorelai is shocked. She never pictured Luke with someone that pretty. Sookie knows exactly what's going on here. Deep down, Lorelai hides feelings or Luke. Of course, Lorelai denies it, but the lady doth protest too much. Meanwhile, Madeline and Louise ditch the concert for a party with the college dudes, and Rory is pissed. What is she supposed to tell Lorelai?

After the concert, Rory and Paris are temporarily stranded. They can't find Lorelai and Sookie right away, so the two stand around and talk. Rory wants to know exactly why Paris likes Tristan so much. Is it just because he's cute? Because there are a lot of cute guys in the world and Tristan is such a tool. But Paris says Tristan isn't always a jerk and she should know, they've known each other since kindergarten. They even have a lot in common. Both Paris and Tristan have not-so-great parents and he even kissed her once (in sixth grade). Still, Rory thinks Paris could do so much better. Paris says she knows Tristan is flirting with her just to get to Rory, but something is better than nothing. Soon, Lorelai shows up and gets really mad when she discovers Madeline and Louise are missing. Since Rory knows the address of the building where the party is at, the four of them go on a mission, knocking on every door in the place. After all, Lorelai came with four girls and she plans to leave with four girls.

After knocking on several doors and coming up empty, they hear music and, bingo, party central. Lorelai comes in and kicks butt, demanding that Madeline and Louise leave pronto. Then, she gives the girls an earful, how stupid do you have to be that you would leave with boys you don't know and consume drinks when you don't know what they contain? And if that's not enough of a vocal smack-down, Lorelai promises that she plans to have a long talk with each of the girls' parents. As they bail, Paris turns to Rory and says this is the best night she's ever had.

At the rummage sale the next day, Lorelai wonders if Rory has heard from any of her so-called friends. Lorelai thought she was doing a good thing by inviting those girls. Well, it wasn't all bad, because Paris is letting Rory share some debate time, which is a monumentally huge deal. When Lorelai spots Luke, he apologizes for his outburst over the rhinestone jacket. Lorelai says it was her fault and she wants to give it back, it obviously means something to him. He takes it and she accepts payment, free coffee.

==Summary==
[[Dean]] and [[Rory]] fight about his approval of the 1950s, pearls-and-meatloaf domestic antics of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Reed Donna Reed], which prompts her to set up a meal in this light when she cat-sits for [[Babette]]. [[Lorelai]] admits to [[Emily]] she might have feelings for [[Luke]] when Emily pesters her about her and Luke's friendship. The episode ends with Rory's father, [[Christopher Hayden]] ([[David Sutcliffe]]), showing up in Stars Hollow. 

==Plot ==
The resident hottie of Stars Hollow, Dean, is about to put his foot into his mouth. He swings by the Gilmore house with pizza and Lorelai and Rory hanging out, watching old episodes of the The Donna Reed Show (it ran from 1958-1966). While the girls mock the way in which Donna acts like the dutiful wife, Dean looks puzzled and says that it seems nice to see a wife cooking dinner for her hubby and taking care of her family. To make matters worse, he innocently states, &quot;Maybe Donna Reed really likes it?&quot; The Gilmore's are outraged. First of all, it's a TV show, second Donna Reed is clearly, and third, the dialogue is written by men. Suddenly, Dean feels very unpopular.

At Luke's, Lorelai announces that the diner definitely needs a facelift, like a paint job. It's just been way too long since Luke has spruced up the joint. Well, crotchety yet charming Luke isn't the sprucing type. And nobody knows that better than Taylor, the head of the &quot;keep Stars Hollow beautiful committee.&quot; And he just happens to be sitting at the counter to overhear Lorelai's suggestion. Next thing you know, Luke is being bombarded with demands, but it's only Lorelai's offer to help paint the place that makes Luke thaw and cave to such requests. Taylor is pleased as punch.

At the Friday night dinner, Rory's grandparents fight over the fact that they aren't able to make their annual trip to the Vineyard because Emily didn't reserve their usual place in time. Lorelai suggest her parents head to Paris instead, but that just won't do. Emily and Richard are creatures of habit. They go to Martha's Vineyard in the spring and Europe in the fall.

The next day, Babette asks Rory to housesit her new kitten, named Apricot, Saturday night. She agrees immediately, leaving Lorelai super suspicious as to why Rory totally jumped at the chance to spend the night away from her. They've only spent one other night away from each other their entire lives. Lorelai is just going to have to deal with it. Besides, when Rory goes to college, she'll be away every night. Then what?

After school that day, Dean meets Rory at the bus stop. Interestingly enough, Rory has a baby chicken in a cage from Chilton (it's a homework assignment). Soon after seeing Dean, Rory invites him over to Babette's house for Saturday night. Dean agrees, but has to leave Rory now because the store where he works is very busy on Thursdays, perhaps due to all those oppressive housewives buying food for dinner. Rory stops dead in her tracks and thus ensues on hairy argument about why Dean actually thinks it's a good idea for women to be cooking dinner and why Rory thinks the whole idea is ridiculous. Rory stands her ground and says that it's not okay for a woman's only purpose in life to be serving someone else. But Dean explains that his own mom cooks dinner every night, so what does that make her? Rory replies, she had a choice in the matter and that is what makes the difference, Donna Reed didn't have a choice. Now the two have landed themselves into a heated argument. The whole thing stops rather abrutly; Dean goes to work, and Rory goes home and it looks like the honeymoon just might be over.

At home, Rory is totally grumpy but doesn't give Lorelai the scoop on Dean. She goes next door to begin her house-sitting gig while Lorelai goes to Luke's to sell him on her favorite paint colors. Luke couldn't be less interested in actually choosing, making Lorelai's world famous perseverance seem not so persuasive after all. After a few beers, though, she seems to loosen him up a little. Basically, he says that as long as Lorelai likes the colors, he approves. Luke then starts talking about his dad, who really loved this old place, it was his life. And now it's Luke's life too. But it used to be a hardware store, and Luke thought a diner would be more, fun. Lorelai thinks it's really nice that Luke feels so connected to his dad, which prompts Luke to remember a spot on the wall where his dad once took an order, and the writing is still on the wall. They find it behind the counter, and in the process get cozy and close. But before they can swap spit or anything, the whole town gathers outside. Apparently this painting gig is a big event in Stars Hollow. She tells Luke to just ignore them; he does and as he looks at her longingly, she just says that she better go.

Cut to Rory caring for the kitten and studying. But she just can't get that conversation with Dean out of her head. She dials his digits but he's out, so she heads over to Lane's to borrow a very specific CD. Only she can't remember the name of it. What follows is a hilarious scene where Lane opens up several random floorboards to reveal hidden CDs, stored in a quirky way that only Lane can understand. It's an ingenious way to keep what her mom would surely call devil music from being snagged away for good. Rory finally finds what she's looking for, but we don't get to see what it is just yet.

When Lorelai gets home from Luke's, she finds that Rory's baby chick has flown the coop. She goes looking all over the house but comes up empty. Then, she calls Luke for help. He agrees to go over there, but has a look on his face, like hmmm. What does this mean? He gets there and is surprised to see that there really is a chick loose in the house. What did he think was going on? When they can't secure the chick, Lorelai puts Luke on the spot and wants to know what he meant by his comment that she really did have a chick in the house. Was he implying that he originally thought Lorelai was calling him over for another reason? And what might that reason be? Luke successfully avoids answering that question and is essentially saved by the chick, which is finally captured.

When Dean calls back, he admits he didn't think Rory would want him to come over. But she does and, conveniently enough, he's right outside and ready to make peace. But he gets the surprise of his life. Rory is dressed up like Donna Reed! Dean doesn't know what to say, so Rory just invites him in to see Babette's house transformed into what looks like the set of The Donna Reed Show. Once he enters, Dean realizes that Rory even made him dinner. What is going on here? Rory thought it was obvious. It's Donna Reed night! Dean is psyched about the dinner. But wait 'till he sees the dessert, green Jello and Cool Whip. When Rory realizes that she forgot to make the rolls, she freaks. Donna would have never forgotten the rolls! Dean just grabs his little housewife honey onto his lap and kisses her. Then he says as great as the whole evening was, he really doesn't want her to be Donna Reed, he's happy with Rory as she is. Rory is happy to hear it, but she's got some information on Donna Reed that totally surprised h er too. Donna was, in fact, an uncredited director and producer on her own show, so she wasn't just an oppressed actress/housewife after all. She was one of the first TV executives. So the whole experience was rather positive. As Rory cleans up the dinner table, Dean takes out the trash. (How man-like.)

After the chick disaster is averted, Luke takes some trash outside for Lorelai and runs right into, Dean. They exchange weird glances and then Lorelai comes out from the Gilmore home and Rory exits Babette's house in her Donna Reed dress. Needless to say, Lorelai is rendered speechless (for just a second), giving Rory a chance to explain the dinner. Now Rory wants to know what her mom and Luke are doing. Luke stutters and stumbles over his words, doesn't really get an answer out, and bails quickly to avoid further embarrassment. Dean does the same, while Lorelai can barely stifle her fits of laughter over Rory's dress.

The next day at the Inn, Lorelai gives Sookie the lowdown on her evening, including Luke's assistance. And the comment he made about her possibly making up the whole situation to get him to come over. Sookie doesn't beat around the bush when she says Luke must have thought Lorelai was calling for something else. (Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.) After all, when Sookie and Jackson finally, &quot;did it&quot;, it was because Sookie originally called to say there was a bat loose in her house. Basically, it was just a ruse to get him into bed. So, maybe Lorelai called Luke for the same reason. Considering that, out of all the people in town, Lorelai called Luke, there just might be something going on here. Lorelai believes it was just a timing thing. Then she gets all flustered and mad, a sure sign that Sookie has struck a nerve.

At the grandparent's place, Emily and Richard announce triumphantly that they have solved their Martha's Vineyard debacle by purchasing a place just after the untimely death of an old friend. Plus, they want Rory and Lorelai to visit for a weekend. This conversation is diverted when the story of the chick arises and it's revealed that Luke is the one who came to the rescue. Emily's interest is peaked. Lorelai just can't get away from people digging for dirt. Emily points out that it seems like this man is always around when Lorelai's in trouble. He was also at Rory's birthday party and was at the hospital when Richard was ill. So Emily assumes there must be something going on. Does Lorelai have feelings for this man? Long pause. Maybe. Emily just wanted her daughter to admit it, but that doesn't mean she's happy about it. Luke is just not the kind of man she wants Lorelai to be dating.

The next day, Lorelai and Luke make a date for Friday night to start the painting. Then, as she and Rory head to the store, they hear the sound of a motorcycle and see a guy coming right into town riding one. The mystery man pulls off his helmet and Rory's dad, Christopher. Rory jumps into his arms and for once, Lorelai is speechless. Christopher is in Stars Hollow for a visit and needs a place to stay. With Rory's suggestion, it is decided that he will stay the Gilmore home. The next thing you know, Rory hops on the back of the bike and they take off together, leaving Lorelai on the sidewalk and whispering, &quot;Christopher.&quot;

==Summary==
[[Christopher]], [[Rory]]'s father and [[Lorelai]]'s old flame, pays a short visit to Stars Hollow. After a dramatic dinner between [[Richard]], [[Emily]], Straub, and Francine (Christopher's parents), Lorelai and Christopher make love on the balcony. Christopher proposes spontaneously to Lorelai, who rejects him and tells him he is not ready for them full time. 

==Plot ==
Now that Christopher has arrived in Stars Hollow, the whole town is buzzing about the real reason he's come back. Especially Rory. After all, he's never been to Stars Hollow before so maybe something has changed, maybe he's here to stay. All super-suspicious Lorelai can do is tell her daughter not to get her hopes up. Having low expectations means you're never disappointed, plus Lorelai knows Christopher a lot better than Rory does.

Christopher, on the other hand, is wide-eyed around Rory, calling her a chip off the perfect block. But Lorelai cuts him off at the compliment and demands that they get down to brass tacks. Why is he here? Well, Christopher's business is finally doing really well and he's come to the decision that he wants to be more involved in Rory's life. All he wants is a chance. Lorelai has always given him chances, but Christopher has just never used them before.

Rory invites her dad to watch a softball game, a game in which Dean just happens to be playing. Is Christopher ready to deal with Rory's boyfriend? It's not easy to hear, but that's what you get when you're never around.

At the game the next day, Dean is at bat (Luke's on the mound) and spots Rory and her dad. He's got a look on his face that says, &quot;Who's that guy?&quot; The two most important men in Rory's life (Dean and her dad) are introduced to each other; they exchange pleasantries and talk motorcycles. It's short, sweet, and uneventful but also awkward. Later, at the Inn, Sookie wants the lowdown on Christopher. Lorelai admits it's weird to have him staying at the Gilmore house but honestly, she doesn't know what she feels. However, she does say that Christopher's charm still works on her, all he has to do is smile and it's, &quot;Ahhh, Christopher.&quot; He knows all her secrets. All her bad-girl moments happened with him.

Meanwhile, Rory's giving dad a tour of Stars Hollow and he gets to see some of the more eclectic towns-folk (like Patty). He also gets to experience the unique and super quick way in which the residents spread gossip. Thanks to Patty's quick fingers on her cell, everyone knows who Christopher is before Rory has a chance to introduce him. And everyone has an opinion on who this hunk looks like, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Billy Crudup, more like an older Joey Lawrence. In order to get away from everyone's opinions, he and Rory slip into the local bookstore, and he offers to buy her any book she wants. She protests at first, but then chooses her dream book, the compact Oxford English Dictionary. It's huge and expensive, but Christopher's got a lot of things to make up for. Too bad he doesn't get the chance. His credit card is rejected. Rory says it's no big and promises to keep this little incident just between her and Christopher. Guess his business isn't doing so well after all.

At the diner, Luke digs for dirt from Lorelai about Christopher. Could this be jealousy? Before he can get the lowdown, the conversation is cut short when the very man in question and Rory enter for a bite to eat. As they all sit, Emily calls on Christopher's cell phone and wants to talk to Lorelai. Christopher's folks are in town too, so Emily announces that they'll all be having dinner together! Both Christopher and Lorelai dread the idea of dinner, but they have no choice but to go.

As soon as they're in the door of the elder Gilmores' house, Richard is asking Christopher about the business. (It only takes two seconds for Lorelai to finish her first martini.) Emily is walking down memory lane and let's say she suffers from revisionist history making. Both Emily and Richard can't help but fawn over and compliment Christopher at every turn. Rory doesn't even recognize her grandparents. Who are these people praising her mom and dad?

When Mr. and Mrs. Hayden (Christopher's parents) arrive, Rory is super nervous. She doesn't know what to call them and when introduced, she actually curtseys. The Hayden's are snobby and stuffy and don't try to hide the fact that they don't like Lorelai at all. When Rory tries to make conversation, she's all mumbles and stutters. In an attempt to change the subject and get Rory off the hook, Lorelai changes the subject to President Bush and how she doesn't like him. The Hayden's (who are major Republicans) think Lorelai is totally out of control. Mr. Hayden then insults Lorelai's line of work (at the Inn) and her life choices. He even brings up the fact that she not only derailed her own life but Christopher's too. (As if it doesn't take two people to make a child.) It's so bad that Richard steps in to make peace. When Mr. Hayden calls Rory &quot;that girl&quot; and makes Lorelai out to be some kind of seductress who trapped Christopher, he's gone too far. Richard grabs Mr. Hayden's lapels and kicks him out, defen ding his daughter like any good father would. The whole thing makes Lorelai feel sixteen all over again.

When it's all over, Richard has retreated to his den; Rory's in the kitchen with Emily and Christopher is solo in the living room. Lorelai tries to talk to her dad, thanking him for what he said. She's touched and grateful that he defended her. She thinks he did it out of protection. But she couldn't be more wrong. Richard did it because the Gilmore name was being trashed. Then, he lays into Lorelai that makes her feel much worse than Mr. Hayden. Essentially, Richard tells his daughter that everything that has happened in the past is not just suddenly fixed because he defended her tonight. In fact, he's angry about what she did so many years ago. She embarrassed and ashamed her family because she was unwilling to marry Christopher. It doesn't matter what Lorelai wanted, sometimes, one must sacrifice in this life; a statement that makes Lorelai feels very sad for her father. And the argument ends there; nothing's resolved, he's tired and she leaves. This night is more awful than she imagined. How long will Lorelai have to pay for her mistakes?

In the kitchen, Rory sits and sulks while Emily tries to make light of the situation. She starts to praise Mr. Hayden and his charity work but then she drops the pretense. She calls him a big ass, a comment that makes Rory smile. Emily, feels bad for her granddaughter, and says very clearly that Rory is not and has never been a disappointment.

Meanwhile, Christopher finds Lorelai out on the balcony to her old room. They chat about the night's events. She's crying; he's comforting; they reminisce about spending time on the balcony, scanning houses for naked people. Christopher pulls out a flask, and they realize they're at the exact same spot where Rory was conceived. Meanwhile, Luke is left high and dry at the diner. Remember, Lorelai was supposed to meet him tonight and help paint? Well, now she's, occupied. Cut to her and Christopher on the balcony making out, stripping off clothes, and getting horizontal. When it's over, Lorelai is more than a little freaked, but Christopher thinks it was really great.

At home, Lorelai tries to make Rory feel better about what happened; but Rory is smart and she knows the Hayden's don't even want to know her. It's their loss and a pretty big one at that. Lorelai says: no regrets. She's trying to be strong for Rory, but the whole night is really taking its toll. In the morning, Lorelai realizes that she has stood up Luke and immediately heads down to the diner. Standing in her coat and pajamas, she apologizes over and over, but Luke is really bummed and says he knew he should have never agreed to paint the diner in the first place. He asks Lorelai if she missed their &quot;date&quot; for an emergency and of course, Lorelai responds with no.

Back at the house, Christopher offers Lorelai coffee and she (gasp!) turns it down. Something is not right in the land of Gilmore. Bottom line: everything is wrong. Then, Christopher throws Lorelai for a major loop. He proposes! Lorelai says that he doesn't know the first thing about family. He can't even buy a book without having his credit card declined. (It wasn't Rory who ratted him out; rather the news was all over town). Christopher shoots back that if he's so irresponsible then why did he want to get hitched way back when it all happened. She doesn't have an answer to that one, but instead demands to know the truth about his business and the fact that he didn't say anything about it at dinner. A moment of silence ends when Christopher says he didn't know how hard it would be to see Rory like this, meaning that maybe it's easier to stay away. Lorelai is quick to point out that that's not the right answer. Rory needs her dad.

Next, Christopher is preparing to leave. Rory asks her father to call home more, twice a week. She knows about the proposal, and wants to know of Lorelai loves him. Lorelai doesn't want to answer but finally says that Christopher wants things he's just not ready for. It just wasn't right and no matter how bad Rory wanted it; she just has to trust her mom on this one.

Later, at Luke's, Lorelai is inside and has painted the whole diner herself. Luke is shocked but has to admit it looks pretty good. And he has to ask, &quot;Where's the guy?&quot; Lorelai tells him that Christopher is gone and things are back to normal, almost.

==Summary==
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19.1875px;&quot;&gt;[[Rory]] and [[Dean]] celebrate their three months of being together, but this ends abruptly when Rory is unable to say three words. [[Lorelai]] realizes her feelings for [[Max]] are still there. Luke's old flame, [[Rachel]], comes to stay. Later on at a festival going on in Stars Hollow, Lorelai, who still has feelings for Max seems very anxious to know if Rachel is staying and if [[Luke]] wants her to, when the only answer given by Luke is &quot;I don't know.&quot; Dean and Rory break up. &lt;/span&gt;
==&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:20px;&quot;&gt;Plot &lt;/span&gt;==
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;The town of Stars Hollow is about to celebrate its founding with the annual Firelight Festival, which just happens to coincide with Dean and Rory's three-month anniversary. While the town prepares to honor its origins, Dean prepares a super-romantic evening with his main squeeze. He meets Rory after school and, even though she is clueless about the anniversary, promises an amazing night if she can manage to get out of the weekly dinner with her grandparents. Rory is unsure she'll be able to do it, but after some begging and pleading from Dean, she agrees to try. At home, she enlists Lorelai as her ambassador, who calls Emily and makes the pitch. Surprisingly, Emily doesn't freak out, rather she gives Rory the night off. Lorelai, however, is still required to attend. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Young love is clearly in the air. Even at Chilton, where Tristan is swallowing the tonsils of a random prep-school girl. In fact, the two swap spit right in front of Paris and Rory's lockers. Paris is pissed, Rory's disgusted, and Tristan just loves rubbing it in both their faces. Over at the Inn, Sookie and Jackson also can't seem to keep their paws off each other either. Even Michel is whispering sweet, French-accented things into the phone to an unknown and unseen paramour. It's enough to make a single girl sick. Especially ones who don't have a date for this weekend, like Lorelai. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, the town is bustling with people and decorations. So much so that Lorelai almost gets clocked with an oversized, decorative star. It puts her in a mood (not a good one), and Luke seconds her emotion, this festival is total bull-crap. He and Lorelai commiserate until a beautiful woman walks through the door, leaving Luke almost speechless. It's Rachel, he ex-girlfriend. An awkward silence occurs until Luke breaks it, and there's some idle chit chat until Lorelai is forced to introduce herself and then proceeds to feel totally inadequate because while Lorelai runs an Inn, Rachel just returned from the Mid-east chronicling how the violence has affected Palestinian and Israeli families. And you just can't compete with that. Not to mention that Lorelai has that rambling problem, which is totally magnified in this uncomfortable situation. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;At home, Lorelai is all worked up about meeting Rachel and just hates herself for babbling like a moron. She can't stand that Rachel and Luke were gazing at each other like long lost loves. Basically, she admits to Rory that she totally misses Max and with all the excitement going on (seeing Christopher, etc.) she hasn't really had time to let the breakup sink in. She even dreamt about Max the other night. Sigh. But Lorelai refuses to dwell and instead helps Rory get ready for her big night. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Later, Lane stops by and is freaking out over her mom's latest set up. Lane's not only meeting a new guy her mom approves of, but seeing his whole family, fourteen future Korean in-laws. Rory has little time to sympathize. Dean arrives, and she runs off for her super-romantic date. Lorelai heads off to Hartford for dinner alone with the folks. When she gets there, Lorelai finds herself alone with Richard for a few minutes and ends up rambling nonstop for several minutes out of total awkwardness. They never really resolved last week's debacle with Christopher's parents. After stringing several sentences together in a way only Lorelai can, Richard tells her to stop, sit, and not talk. And then to Lorelai's utter horror, a single, suited man, Chase Bradford, enters the house, and he's clearly meant to be a date for Lorelai. Emily plays it off like a total spontaneous thing, but we all know it's not in any way spontaneous. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Lorelai drags Emily out of the room for forty lashes and now understands why she was so generous and congenial when Rory wanted out of dinner. Emily feels she has done nothing wrong and asks Lorelai if it would kill her to keep an open mind. After all, think about this: Tonight Rory is celebrating her 3-month anniversary. When is the last time Lorelai had a relationship that lasted that long? Ouch. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;At a romantic Italian Bistro, Rory is have an absolute perfect time. Dean is nervous, he wants everything to be just right and wants her to have everything she wants. Rory insists that everything is just right and she does have everything she wants. But wait, the night is far from over. Dean starts talking about phase two of the anniversary dinner, leaving Rory to wonder just what does he have in store? &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Back in Hartford, Lorelai's dinner date isn't going so well. Of course, Lorelai's wit does not gel with Chase's square personality. He's an actuary, a profession that is all numbers, zero thought or creativity. Chase couldn't be more wrong for Lorelai. He's even boring Richard. Emily, on the other hand, is eating it all up, laughing at the bad jokes in the hopes that he and Lorelai will hit it off. Of course, Chase is digging Lorelai big time. Essentially, the only thing for her to do is try and escape. She bails to her room, grabs her coat, starts to sneak out of the balcony and is busted by Richard. But he does a totally un-Richard thing, he lets her leave without saying a word to Emily. Maybe Richard's got a soft spot for his daughter after all. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Back with Rory and Dean, he brings her to a salvage yard to present her with his gift. Which is the beginning of a car that he plans to build for her, piece by piece. Rory is overwhelmed. This has got to be the single greatest thing anyone has every done for her. She gets behind the wheel, he slips into the passenger seat, and they kiss over and over, and Rory states that this moment is so perfect, it just might make her sad because nothing could ever be this good again. Then, Dean puts what he believes is the icing on a very romantic cake. He tells Rory that he loves her. And the silence that follows is deafening. There's a look of shock on Rory's face, and Dean is devastated. She doesn't love him? She says she needs to think about it; but he says there's no need to think about it, she either feels it or she doesn't it. And now he feels like a total idiot. Rory tries to explain her point of view, but nothing matters now. Dean just wants to go home. An awful end to what was a perfect evening. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Back at the festival, Lorelai walks around alone, Sookie and Jackson have a really nice time, and Rachel takes pictures and hangs with Luke. Poor Lane walks around with fourteen Korean people. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;Finally, Luke demands to know why Rachel is really here. She missed him, simple as that. But she does have a tendency to leave, so how excited can he really get? Rachel wants to know what's going on between him and Lorelai. All Luke says is that they are friends and that's it. And to change the subject, Luke admits that he is really happy to see Rachel, even if he doesn't show it. Then Rachel goes to grab some punch, giving Lorelai a chance to chit chat with Luke, and bicker, and flirt. (Like they always do.) So is Rachel staying? He doesn't know. Does he want her to? He doesn't know. But maybe he will to make it work with her, you know, stop analyzing and just go for it. Luke goes to find Rachel, leaving Lorelai alone again. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;When she gets home, Lorelai dials Max's number and gets his machine. She doesn't get the chance to leave a message, though, because Rory walks in, tears on her face and announces that she and Dean just broke up.&lt;/span&gt;

==Synopsis==
Lorelai is becoming seriously involved with Max just as she finds herself getting in the middle of another relationship when Luke's girlfriend Rachel accuses him of being in love with Lorelai.

==Plot outline==
[[Paris Gellar|Paris]] wreaks her revenge after [[Tristan DuGrey|Tristan]] lies about going to a concert with [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]. [[Rachel]] leaves [[Stars Hollow]] after she becomes convinced that despite his protests, [[Luke Danes|Luke]] is in love with [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]]. Rory's defense of the Stars Hollow troubadour during a town meeting brings her back together with [[Dean Forester|Dean]], enabling her to finally say, and mean, the words that he's been longing to hear. Luke and [[Max Medina|Max]] meet and engage in a little not-so-friendly rivalry as Max begins to suspect, despite her protests, that Lorelai and Luke were once an item. Max proposes to Lorelai with a thousand yellow daisies.

==Synopsis==
When Rory and Tristan are cast as Romeo and Juliet in a school play, a jealous Dean insists on attending every rehearsal. Lorelai has to put up with Luke's teasing after she dates a much younger guy.

==Plot outline==
[[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] receives a late wedding present without a card attached, and insists that it be returned. [[Sookie St. James|Sookie]] sees to what great lengths Lorelai is going to find out who sent it, and tells Lorelai to move forward in life to get some closure on her relationship with [[Max Medina|Max]]. Lorelai takes her advice and accepts a dinner date with Paul, one of the other students in her business class. When Paul stops by the diner, both the town and [[Luke Danes|Luke]] react to Lorelai's dating decision. The town finds a lot to be amused by as Paul arrived at the diner with his parents and wearing a backwards baseball cap making him look much younger. 

[[Rory Gilmore|Rory]], [[Paris Gellar|Paris]], [[Madeline Lynn|Madeline]], and [[Louise Grant|Louise]] are assigned to present the death scene from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; as part of their class participation in the [[Chilton Preparatory School|Chilton]] Shakespearean Festival. Paris takes over as director and assigns Rory the role of Juliet. [[Tristan DuGrey|Tristan]] returns to school with Duncan and Bowman after their suspension, and is cast as Romeo against Rory's wishes. Throughout rehearsals Rory is trying her best to keep Dean from attending them and finding out that Tristan is Romeo to her Juliet. While watching her other classmates perform, Rory learns that Tristan is going to military school in North Carolina for breaking into Bomer's father's safe and being caught when the silent alarm went off.

Lorelai is coerced by her mother into taking her father for a day in Stars Hollow, where he proceeds to drive her batty while criticizing every aspect of her life.

==Plot outline==
[[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] visits [[Stars Hollow]], and drives [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] crazy by passing judgment on every aspect of her life, from her eating habits to how she conducts her work. Elsewhere (to her mother's dismay), [[Rory]] ends up having to help [[Paris Gellar|Paris]] when she visits Stars Hollow searching for a &quot;seedy underbelly&quot; for the front story of [[The Franklin]].

After returning to Lorelai's house, he says that Rory may accept the car and everything is fine. Lorelai gets very angry at him for making Dean take the car to Gypsy's to get checked, and states that she is the parent and she will decide about what is best for Rory, not him.

==Synopsis==
Christopher and his girlfriend Sherry visit Stars Hollow.

==Plot outline==
[[Christopher Hayden|Christopher]] comes to town on a business trip with his girlfriend [[Sherry Tinsdale]] in tow. Since Sherry and Christopher's relationship is getting serious, Sherry wants to begin bonding with [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] -- on Friday night. Without consulting [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]], [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] excuses Rory from the Gilmore [[Friday night dinner]], and takes Christopher with her instead. When Emily finds out about Sherry over cocktails, she has a meltdown and rushes off to the kitchen. Lorelai follows her there and finds out that Emily always envisioned that Lorelai and Christopher would end up together. Now that she sees that this isn't going to happen, Emily blames Lorelai for always keeping him, and everyone else, at arms length. After mulling over her mother's words, the next morning Lorelai tells Christopher that she believes she's always thought that they would get back together, too, and that's one reason why she's never had a relationship that lasted, including the one with [[Max]]. Christopher gets very angry, refusing to accept the responsibility for the way Lorelai's romantic life has turned out. Lorelai immediately apologizes, saying she didn't mean it blamefully, but more as self-realization, but Christopher is too angry to listen.

==Synopsis==
After helping Rory out with her business project for the annual Chilton Business Fair, Richard realizes retirement isn't for him.

==Plot outline==
[[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] asks [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] for help in creating and marketing a first-aid kit for [[Chilton Preparatory School|Chilton]]'s annual Business Fair, which leads him to realize that he is unhappy in retirement and wants to start a second career. Fresh from having underbid on Rory's lunch basket and the loss of the bracelet he made for her, [[Dean Forester|Dean]] goes overboard in trying to be close to Rory, afraid that she is losing interest in him, and finally becomes resigned to her affection for [[Jess Mariano|Jess]]. At first, [[Michel Gerard|Michel]] is ecstatic when his flamboyant mother [[Giselle]] visits, but after [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] causes problems for him when she reveals to Giselle that Michel has been holding back from his mother, Michel quickly is driven crazy by his mother's incessant questioning.

==Plot outline==
[[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]]'s complaint about [[Taylor Doose|Taylor]]'s choice for &quot;Movie in the Square Night&quot; lands her the responsibility for picking the evening's entertainment, but her enthusiasm for the task is quickly dampened when Taylor informs her that she must make a choice from a list of free movies which doesn't include any masterpieces.

==Synopsis==
Rory invites her grandparents to her mom's graduation, but misses it herself after cutting school to meet Jess in New York.

==Plot outline==
[[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] have breakfast at [[Sookie St. James|Sookie]]'s in an effort to avoid [[Luke]]'s, but Lorelai can't avoid an awkward encounter with him at [[Doose's Market]], where he fails to pick up on her hints to patch things up. In an effort to help Lorelai through final exam stress, Rory gets her excited about attending her college graduation ceremony and secretly invites [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]], despite Lorelai's assertion that they'd never agree to attend. After a late night phone call from [[Jess Mariano|Jess]], Rory impulsively cuts school the next day and visits him in Manhattan. [[Christopher Hayden|Christopher]] sends Lorelai a graduation gift basket filled with fun goodies and an expensive necklace.

Rory is furious with herself when her bus home is delayed and she misses her mother's graduation. When Rory finally arrives home, Lorelai forgives her when she realizes that the trip to New York may indicate that her daughter has fallen in love with Jess, despite her protests to the contrary.

==Synopsis==
A night at the fights, Rory has it out with Jess, and Lorelai goes a rhetorical round or two with Christopher. But Lorelai has another chance at swept-off-her-feet romance: Kirk asks her out on a date.

==Plot outline==
To Lorelai's horror, Kirk asks her out on a date after being encouraged by Luke. Emily's lunch with Lorelai at Luke's ends badly. Christopher shows up uninvited at Friday night dinner and quarrels with both Lorelai and Rory before Emily asks him to leave. Rory runs into Jess and they each betray their hurt feelings -- Rory about Shane and Jess about not hearing from Rory all summer. Francie targets Paris and Rory for a world of trouble if Rory doesn't stop Paris from running the student council like a dictatorship.

==Synopsis==
Hackneyed, perfunctory, run-of-the-mill - that's Rory. When her Harvard application arrives, her confidence disappears. And soon three generations of Gilmore girls share one giant anxiety attack.

==Plot outline==
Rory's application for Harvard arrives, plunging Rory, Lorelai and Emily into a frenzy. A Chilton seminar on college applications only adds to Rory's anxiety and sends Paris into a tizzy. Taylor steamrollers Luke into opening a soda shop next to the diner. Lane places an ad in the paper for a band and finds a musical soulmate. Lorelai and Rory have dinner with a Harvard alumni and his family which may assure her chances of acceptance. Dean has a talk with Rory about their future after she goes to Harvard.

==Synopsis==
Bring your briefcase, your notes, and your scarlet &quot;A.&quot; Lorelai plans to give an inspiring business talk at Stars Hollow High School's career day, but all the kids want to discuss is her teenage pregnancy.

==Plot outline==
Lorelai's stint in the Stars Hollow High School local business success speakers forum gets derailed by some controversial personal questions, much to the delight of Luke and the consternation of some PTA mothers. Luke and Jess argue about the women in and out of their lives (and their closets). Lane alleviates her frustration about the strictures of her household and the future of her band through a colorful, if temporary, display of independence. Rory runs into Shane one too many times and succumbs to a severe bout of snarkiness.

==Synopsis==
Lorelai and Rory partner for a 24-hour dance marathon. Couples, couples everywhere: dancing, arguing, holding each other up, shooting each other down...and changing partners.

==Plot outline==
Lorelai is determined to win the Stars Hollow Dance Marathon and wrest the trophy from four-time champion Kirk, but has trouble getting a partner until she finally convinces Rory to help her dance her way to victory. Dean sits on the sidelines to cheer his girl on, and is soon joined by Jess and Shane, who spend their time making out while Jess keeps his eye on Rory. Lorelai breaks her heel, and Dean takes her place while Luke plays shoe repairman. On the dance floor, Dean realizes that Rory is attracted to Jess and breaks up with her. Rory tearfully runs off, followed closely by Jess, and Kirk is declared the winner once again.

==Synopsis==
Richard has the Bulldog spirit when he, Emily, Lorelai, and Rory tour Yale.  Rory goes through with the tour to please her grandparents. Richard even arranges an admission interview for Rory, although he knows she has her heart set on Harvard. Rory and Jess renew their romance.

==Plot outline==
In the aftermath of the Dance Marathon, Kirk parades around Stars Hollow with the trophy until someone steals it, while Lorelai and Rory painfully inch their way towards Luke's. After Lorelai tells Luke about Rory and Jess, he breaks up their first kiss as a couple and then lays down some ground rules with Jess about dating Rory. Lorelai and Rory reluctantly agree to accept Richard's invitation to accompany him and Emily to his Whiffenpoof reunion at Yale, where he springs quite an unwelcome surprise on all three women. Back from New Haven, Lorelai and Rory head for Luke's, and Jess and Rory finally get to have those first kisses. Rory visits Dean to apologize and tell him that she misses his friendship. Late at night, Lorelai and Rory each curl up with some bedtime reading -- the Yale brochure.

==Synopsis==
Sherry goes into labor, and that sets Lorelai reminiscing about Rory's birth. Did you know that Lorelai went to the hospital alone? Or about the coming-out dress? Here's your chance to find out.

==Plot outline==
[[Luke Danes|Luke]] and [[Nicole Leahy|Nicole]] have a successful first date. [[Jess Mariano|Jess]] and [[Dean Forester|Dean]] trade verbal blows. [[Sherry Tinsdale|Sherry]] goes into labor with only [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] for company until the final moments, while [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] has flash backs about her teen romance with [[Christopher Hayden|Christopher]], her pregnancy and Rory's birth. [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] decry Lorelai's and Rory's plans to backpack through Europe, which it turns out she and [[Christopher |Christopher]] had toyed with doing as teens. The war between [[Paris Gellar|Paris]] and Rory continues when Paris picks a yearbook photo of the &quot;Franklin&quot; staff that has the worst possible shot of Rory. The episode concludes with Lorelai surprising Emily with a touching gift, inspired by her regrets at the way she hurt her parents when she left home after Rory's birth.

==Memorable Quotes==
'''Rory''': Headmaster Charleston, faculty members, fellow students, family and friends, welcome. We never thought this day would come. We prayed for its quick delivery, crossed days off our calendars, counted hours, minutes and seconds and now that it's here, I'm sorry it is, because it means leaving friends who inspire me and teachers who've been my mentors, so many people who've shaped my life, and my fellow students lives impermeably and forever. I live in two worlds. One is a world of books. I've been a resident of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod, fought alongside Napoleon, sailed a raft with Huck and Jim, committed absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly, rode a sad train with Anna Karenina and strolled down Swann's Way. It's a rewarding world, but my second one is by far superior. My second one is populated with characters slightly less eccentric, but supremely real, made of flesh and bone, full of love, who are my ultimate inspiration for everything. Richard and Emily Gilmore are kind, decent, unfailingly generous people. They are my twin pillars, without whom I could not stand. I am proud to be their grandchild. But my ultimate inspiration comes from my best friend, the dazzling woman from whom I received my name and my life's blood, Lorelai Gilmore. My mother never gave me any idea that I couldn't do whatever I wanted to do or be whomever I wanted to be. She filled our house with love and fun and books and music unflagging in her efforts to give me role models from Jane Austen to Eudora Welty to Patti Smith. As she guided me through these incredible eighteen years, I don't know if she ever realized that the person I most wanted to be was her. Thank you Mom, you are my guidepost for everything.
==Mistakes==
In the scene where Lorelai is telling Rory about the money issue her shirt only shows &quot;PEAC&quot; because her sweater is covering the &quot;E&quot; but in the next shot &quot;PEACE&quot; is showing.



==Trivia==

In the episide [[Swan Song]], Emily makes mention that Gran will be at graduation when trying to scare Roryn into meeting Jess, pointing out that she, Richard and Gran will get to meet him at the same time during that moment. However, Gran does not show up, nor is there any mention of her absence.

They begin dating and he pretends to be a Christian guitarist to gain her mother's approval, he does not, however, gain it until late in the season as he is not Korean. He is later replaced by [[Gil]] in the band, after he moves to California for college. Dave is mentioned a few more times as a long distance boyfriend but the relationship between Lane and Dave ends after a fight over the marriage jug - the last mention of him. He does not appear again in the show.[[File:AdamDaveRygalski.jpg|thumb]]

==Trivia==
Dave is named after [[Helen Pai]]'s [[Dave Rygalski (Helen Pai's Husband)|real-life husband]]. Helen told [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] stories about their dating which inspired scenes for the show.

Adam Brody left the show to star in The O.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1867">'''[[File:Gilmore-girls-tippecanoe-09.jpg|thumb]]Gil''' is the guitarist for the band, [[Hep Alien]], and is portrayed by [[Sebastian Bach]], the former lead singer of metal band Skid Row.

After [[Dave Rygalski|Dave]]'s departure, Hep Alien is short of a guitar player. After some time of placing ads and explaining rock history to failing candidates on the phone, [[Lane Kim]] invites '''Gil''' to play with them in [[Lorelai Gilmore]]'s garage. At first the band members (especially [[Zack Van Gerbig]]) voice some reservations about his age (they reckon Gil is in his late thirties or even early forties), but eventually Lane decides unilaterally to let Gil join the band. Gil remains an integral part of Hep Alien. He has a history as a legitimate rock-and-roll musician, and the others in the band often get their cues about what it means to be &quot;rock and roll&quot; from him. For instance, he was able to convince them his bandmates that the proposed tour of Seventh Day Adventists churches was &quot;totally rock and roll.&quot;

He has a day job as an owner of a submarine sandwich shop and often comes to practices in his uniform.

He is married with children. His wife has appeared briefly on-camera, but did not have a speaking role. When she's on camera she is usually making out with Gil.

'''Hep Alien''' is [[Lane Kim]]'s band. Originally it was formed with [[Dave Rygalski]] (guitar), [[Brian]] (bass), [[Zack]] (guitar), and Lane (drums). Later, when Dave leaves for college in California, [[Gil]] is chosen as his replacement. The band's first gig is at a house party, where they play cover tunes. Though the band breaks up when Lane and Zack break up, they get back together a few months later, and pursue their steady climb to minor success, with a profitable tour (of Seventh Day Adventists churches) to its credit.

The band name is an anagram of [[Helen Pai]], who is show producer [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]]'s best friend.

He and Zack had a bunk bed in the living room.

His character is the arguably the least-defined of the group, however we know some of his quirks. For instance, he has a collection of Futurama figurines, and likes playing videogames. We know that he at least occassionally writes songs with Zack, but Zack feels he gives in too easily. He suffers from a number of ailments, including asthma, hypoglycemia, deviated septum, and rosacea. He wears glasses.

In one storyline, Brian wrote a song called &quot;Lane,&quot; while Zack and Lane were dating, though he never showed any romantic interest in Lane. He was however interested in Kyon (played by Susane Lee), a foreign exchange student taken in by Mrs. Kim after Lane moves out. She and Brian are seen flirting multiple times throughout the last seasons.

==Synopsis==
Warp speed. The Gilmore girls cram one-and-a-half weeks of activites into three days so Rory can attend Yale orientation. But Luke wins the Road Runner contest. He got married during a summer cruise - and now he's getting divorced.

==Plot Outline==
[[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] return from their whirlwind tour of Europe. [[Taylor Doose|Taylor]] doesn't take it well when Rory declines the privilege of being the [[Stars Hollow]] Ice Cream Queen. Lorelai and Rory get caught up in a flurry of activity after Rory realizes that she wrote down the wrong date for freshman orientation, and she only has two days to get ready for [[Yale]], instead of the week she was planning on. [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] is upset when Lorelai misses Friday night dinner and retaliates by turning it into a four hour extravaganza, complete with ballroom dancing videos before the souffle course. Lorelai is shocked when [[Luke Danes|Luke]] finally tells her what happened on his cruise with [[Nicole Leahy|Nicole]].

==Plot outline==
The rift between [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] and [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] widens when he goes on a golf date with clients instead of accompanying his wife to the funeral of her best friend. [[Doyle McCaster|Doyle]] goes on a theft and plagiarism rant. [[Lorelai &quot;Trix&quot; Gilmore|Trix]] dies suddenly and stricken with grief and guilt, Richard is inconsolable. Emily calls it quits on arranging Trix's funeral and drops everything in her daughter's lap after finding a letter in which her mother-in-law pleads with her son on the eve of his wedding to Emily to marry [[Pennilyn Lott|Pennilyn]] instead. [[Luke Danes|Luke]] and [[Nicole Leahy|Nicole]] have all of [[Stars Hollow]] listening in and reading lips as they quarrel. Worried about her parents and frantic over fulfilling Trix's exacting requirements for her funeral, [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] has a meltdown while shopping for Trix's funereal undies. After the service, cousin Marilyn regales family and friends with tales of Lorelai the First. Emily and Richard finally reach out to each other as he defies one of his mother's last wishes for the sake of his wife.

Luke comes to the rescue when [[Kirk Gleason|Kirk]]'s failure to make a map of the Easter eggs he hid in the town square gets Taylor's nose out of joint. Richard and Jason discover that Floyd's peacemaking overtures are a disguise for his plan to ruin Richard financially by suing them for stealing his clients. While shopping with [[Lane Kim|Lane]] in [[Doose's Market|Doose's]], Rory has harsh words about [[Lindsay Lister|Lindsay]] as she relates her quarrel with [[Dean Forester|Dean]] over his plans to drop out of college to earn more money to buy a house, unaware that his wife is listening in the next aisle. Richard resolves his problems with Floyd at Jason's expense. Dean and Rory agree to continue their friendship despite Lindsay's demand that they stop speaking to each other.

==Synopsis==
Things couldn't be better/worse. The inn's test run is a success. Lorelai and Luke's fledgling romance takes wing. Emily and Richard's marriage is in shreds. Rory and Lorelai aren't talking after Rory's liaison with Dean.

==Plot outline==
Things are still tense between [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]. [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] announces that she and [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] have separated. [[Sookie St. James|Sookie]] is ecstatic to learn that [[Luke Danes|Luke]] and Lorelai kissed. [[Dean Forester|Dean]] provokes an argument with an unsuspecting [[Lindsay Lister|Lindsay]] after his indiscretion with Rory. Emily decides to go to Europe and invites Rory to accompany her. Lorelai and Luke are very tentative with each other the day after until they are able to reassure each other that they're on the right path. Luke heads off to Maine for a week to help [[Liz Danes|Liz]] and [[T.J.]] after an accident.

==Synopsis==
Luke and Lorelai finally go on their first date where Luke tells Lorelai he wants a relationship with her. Back at Yale Rory moves into her new dorm and is worried when Paris isn't already moved in. Paris informs her that Asher has passed away.

==Plot outline==
[[Luke Danes|Luke]] and [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] go on their official first date at a restaurant owned by old friends of Luke's parents. Luke reminds Lorelai of how they met, shows her a horoscope she gave him for good luck that he's[[File:First_meeting_logan.jpg|thumb|Logan Huntzberger and his friends recognizing Marty.]] kept in his wallet, and assures her that he intends to go the distance with her. Lorelai spends the night at Luke's place. In the morning, she goes down to the diner to get coffee, and the breakfast crowd sees her wearing only Luke's shirt. There's surprisingly little gossip about Luke and Lorelai until the next town meeting, where [[Taylor Doose|Taylor]] uses charts to show how disastrous a breakup between them would be for [[Stars Hollow]]. Meanwhile: [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] meets a rich [[Yale]] student named [[Logan Huntzberger]] and chews him out for being rude to her friend [[Marty]]. [[Paris Gellar|Paris]] holds a wake for [[Asher Flemming|Asher]] that all the guests assume is a keg party with a weird theme. [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] freaks out when she discovers that [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] has a social life she doesn't know about, so she invades Rory's dorm during the wake.

==Synopsis==
Jackson decides to run against Taylor for town selectman, Rory and Dean try to work out their relationship, Lane tells Zach she likes him.
==Plot Outline==

Lorelai is trying to get a permit for two extra parking spaces for the inn, but Taylor keeps rejecting her applications. Taylor is also going after Jackson for the greenhouse he recently had built because it’s too close to the edge of his property. Jackson goes crazy and decides he’s going to run against Taylor in the upcoming election for town selectman. It’s kind of a weird thing because nobody ever runs against Taylor. Lorelai and Sookie set up their campaign table at Luke’s.

Dean and Rory are supposed to hang out, but he calls and says Lindsay has the car and he can’t get there. Rory drives to Stars Hollow to hang out at his house. It’s nice to see his sister, Clara, again, but Dean’s mom is kind of bitchy and disapproving. She makes Dean leave the door open while he and Rory are in his room and oh man do I not miss hanging out with my high school boyfriends in their rooms at their parents’ houses. The next time they get together, they make out in Rory’s car, which is problematic for Dean since he’s about ten feet tall. Rory asks Dean to go to Jackson’s rally with her, but he yells at her for even suggesting such a thing because he doesn’t want to flaunt the relationship all over town and rub Lindsay’s nose in it.

Lorelai asks Lane’s band to play at a rally for Jackson. The voting starts, and Lane’s band is just then given a tape of the song Jackson wants them to play. They’ve never heard it before, but they’re going to go on and play it in like five minutes. Kirk has been polling, and he says everyone in town plans to vote for Jackson. Lorelai is happy, but then she looks through the window in the diner and sees Taylor sitting by himself in the dark in his soda shoppe. She thinks it’s sad.

Jackson gets on stage and says he has no idea why he’s running for selectman. He already has a job and not a lot of time and he doesn’t want to be selectman. The crowd just loves him more for being an honest man and of course he wins. Only ten people vote for Taylor, most of them because Lorelai asked them to.

After the rally, Zack brings a couple of tramps back to the apartment. Lane hasn’t told Zack she likes him because she’s worried it will break up the band, but she just can’t stand to see him with these girls so she tells him she likes him and then goes to her room. Zack goes outside to think about things.

Dean comes up to Rory at the rally and apologizes for yelling the other night. He says he worked things out with his car and talked to his mom so things are going to be better. Rory asks if Dean would have left Lindsay if she hadn’t found her letter. Dean kind of does that weird grin of his and says yes, of course he would have left her.

==Synopsis==
A double date between Lorelai and Luke with Rory and Dean goes wrong. Emily and Richard are getting use to living separately but accompanied by a panic room and a glittering vest.
==Plot outline==
[[File:Bopit.png|thumb|left|Dean and Luke tugging the Bop-It.]]
Dean is still doing some work at the Dragonfly, but is avoiding Lorelai. In an attempt to show Rory that she's okay with her relationship with Dean Lorelai insists that they hang out together, like they use to. Rory thinks it’s going to be weird and Luke isn't happy with the idea after agreeing to a double date. Rory goes to Dean’s new place where he is Kyle's roommate. Dean’s not sure about the double date thing, either, but Rory talks him into it.

The date has an awkwardly polite start with Dean explaining to Luke how to do date night, which includes getting food from Al's Pancake World because the food is already bad to begin with, unlike the food from Luke's diner. The only movie Kirk has available at the theater is Pippi Longstockings. While Dean and Rory get popcorn, Luke complains to Lorelai about Dean and Lorelai insists that he gets on better terms with Dean.

By the time they reach the Gilmore house Luke is still making Dean uncomfortable. Rory tries to remind them of the time they were on a softball team together, but that doesn't make anything better. Lorelai pulls out the Bop-It and the boys end up getting fiercely competitive. Luke wins and starts yelling about Dean being the loser. Dean leaves disgusted and Rory yells at Luke, letting him know that Bop-It is the Gilmores' solution to emergency [[File:Glittervest.png|thumb|Emily asking the girls why Richard would wear such a vest.]]social situations. After she leaves, Luke apologizes and tells Lorelai he doesn’t think Dean is good enough for Rory.

While at Friday night dinner, the girls learn that Emily has purchased a panic room. Emily takes the girls to the pool house ostensibly to get some gin, but really just to snoop since Richard is out of town. Emily finds plenty to shock her such as an abundance of breath mints and a glittering vest in the closet.

Elsewhere Zack hasn’t commented since Lane told him she likes him. Not knowing what she did wrong or what to do, Lane tells him she’s changed her mind and doesn’t like him anymore. Zach shows up at the diner later and says he’s a little slow and he was just processing. He likes her, too, but he’s going to need some time.
==Trivia==
*Luke was a &quot;pippi virgin&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Norman Mailer visits the Dragonfly Inn and is testing Sookie's patience. Rory does research on the Life and Death Brigade for the Yale Daily News, which leads her right back to Logan Huntzberger.
==Plot outline==
Everyone at the Yale Daily News spent their summers doing internships and being published in the New York Times and Rory panics in fear she hasn’t done enough for her career. Logan Huntzberger arrives after the assignments have been handed out and when Rory asks Doyle why he is letting Logan get away with not doing anything, Doyle informs her it’s because Logan is the son of Mitchum Huntzberger, the newspaper magnate.

Rory is thrilled to have the features beat and decides to write about illegal music downloading. While trying to conduct a ground breaking interview with a fellow Yale student, she realizes it’s a dead end. While in the bathroom a girl walks in wearing a gorilla mask and a ball gown. Rory follows her outside, where the girl shouts in Latin before getting into a black SUV. Rory does some research and finds out the Latin phrase is the motto for a secret society at Yale called the Life and Death Brigade. Doyle tells her that everybody knows the society exists, but nobody knows that it does. Rory decides to change her article to undercover the truth about the club and in the course of late night research she discovers that Logan’s grandfather was in the society. Assuming that membership follows family lineage, Rory questions Logan about the Life and Death Brigade. He denies any knowledge, but instant messages her the next day in the newspaper office to tell her he can get her on the inside to write her article.

Back in Stars Hollow, Lorelai receives a desperate phone call from Christopher. Gigi won’t stop crying, Sherry isn’t home and he doesn’t know what to do. Lorelai races to Boston to help out and after getting Gigi quiet Chris says Sherry took a job in Paris, leaving him with their daughter. He thinks he can’t raise her alone, but Lorelai says he can and he will because he has to.

Norman Mailer is at the Dragonfly Inn and is annoying Sookie because he sits for hours without ordering anything but iced tea. Sookie becomes more irritated when the Dragonfly’s financial adviser suggests they drop lunch because it’s not making any money. Lorelai can't figure out what's up with Sookie.

The girls arrive for Friday night dinner and the maid says Richard is out of town and Emily is at a function. Lorelai decides they should order pizza and eat it on the floor in the living room. After getting comfy Lorelai tells Rory about Christopher and says she plans to go back and help him with Gigi. Rory goes to Christopher’s a few days later and tells him she doesn’t want him to call Lorelai anymore because she’s in a relationship now and she doesn’t want him to mess it up.

Lorelai finally has to confront Sookie when Luke calls, upset, because Kirk is front of the diner handing out flyers to promote lunch at the Dragonfly. Sookie goes into the dining room and yells at Norman Mailer, telling him it’s all his fault. Lorelai drags her away and Sookie says she doesn’t know why she’s freaking out. Suddenly, she realizes she’s pregnant. She runs back out to the dining room and tells Norman Mailer in excitement.

At the end of the episode Lorelai goes to the diner and asks Luke why he’s crabby. He nods to a table and complains that a couple of guys are sitting for hours and only ordering iced tea.

==Synopsis==
As promised, Logan lets Rory get the scoop on the &quot;Life and Death Brigade&quot;. After learning that Lorelai is dating Luke Emily insists on meeting him and later, Richard decides to meet him too.
==Plot outline==
[[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] has found out that Lorelai is dating [[Luke Danes|Luke]] and insists on re-meeting him. Lorelai pleads with Luke that he doesn't have to attend dinner, but he insists that they get it over with sooner rather than later. Emily is perfectly pleasant at first, but it becomes clear that everything from her offer of beer to her descriptions of what she has heard about diners to his truck being “rustic” are all meant to be insults.

Not one to be outdone Richard calls and invites Luke to go golfing with him. Lorelai calls Richard and asks him to cancel, but he says it’s protocol and it needs to be done. When Luke gets to the country club, Richard makes him buy some golf clubs. Luke has no idea how to golf, but he’s a pretty good sport an[[File:Emilyandluke.png|thumb|left|260px|Emily making conversation with Luke.]]d the caddy helps him out a little. Richard tells him he should franchise the diner; he’ll set him up with a banker and a barber for a straight razor shave. That night, Emily yells at Richard for going golfing with Luke because he’s not suitable for Lorelai. Richard says that if the relationship continues, he wants Luke to at least be a respectable person that he wouldn’t be embarrassed to take to the club and he would only be a figurehead for the franchise anyway.

Rory finds an envelope taped to her suite's window. It’s from the Life and Death Brigade, telling her to be blindfolded and in her vestibule the next day at four. Logan and his friends, Fin and Colin, pick her up and take her somewhere in the woods.

Rory tries to conduct an interview with the members but Logan explains later that they are not welcoming of outsiders and he had twist arms to allow her to take part. He takes away her camera and avoids any questions she asks but gives her rules to follow. The next morning, Logan tells Rory to look under the cot in her tent where she finds a ball gown. The group has moved out of the woods and into an open area where the guys are wearing tuxedos and the girls are in gowns similar to Rory's.

There’s a big scaffolding in the field with four people standing on top of it with parasols. Logan says they’re going to jump, and he and Rory are going to jump with them. The two go back and forth and Logan finally convinces Rory to jump when he tells her about George Plimpton, Hunter Thompson and other journalists who participated before writing their greatest pieces. After jumping off the scaffolding Rory is exhilarated and says it was a once in a lifetime experience and Logan tells her it is only if she wants it to be.

Back in her suite Rory is seen working on her laptop when she hears a knock at her door. [[File:Thejump.jpg|thumb|260px|The famous jump scene.]]When she answers it no one is seen, but a lone gorilla mask, a bottle of wine and Rory’s camera have been laid on her doorstep. She browses the saved pictures and sees a few of her and Logan jumping off the scaffolding.

Back in Stars Hollow, Zack tells Lane he’s ready to date her. They don't have enough money to go out and not knowing what to do, they decide to hang out on the couch in the living room. Brian comes home and sits between them, and Zack explains to him that they’re on a date. After asking what he's suppose to do then, Lane gives Brian permission to be in her room. When the date is over, Zack picks up a sleeping Brian and carries him to bed. While Brian is on his shoulder, Zack kisses Lane goodnight.

==Synopsis==
Emily and Richard host a party for Yale alumni (and their sons) but Rory is the unknowing guest-of-honor and it ends her relationship with Dean for good. Luke and Lorelai have a complicated dinner date, perhaps because T.J. is there too.
==Plot Outline==
Rory mentions that she's dating [[Dean Forester|Dean]] again and her grandparents decide to throw a party to introduce her to more &quot;suitable&quot; young men. [[Logan Huntzberger|Logan]] shows up at the party, clearly well-acquainted with Rory's grandparents. He and some friends form a less-boring sub-party with Rory in the poolhouse. The guys accompany her to the front door when she goes to meet Dean and Dean decides he doesn't belong with Rory anymore.

Emily is upset with Richard for serving the girls appetizers with their drinks because she doesn't want them to be full before going into the house for dinner. Rory’s cell phone rings during dinner and upon questioning she tells her grandmother that the call was from Dean - they are back together. A few days later Emily and Richard call Rory to invite her over early for dinner on Friday because they’re throwing a party for their Yale alumni friends.

Dean and Rory haven’t had much luck lately finding time together, so they have lunch in the store room at Doose’s on Dean’s lunch break on Friday. He says he read her story about the Life and Death Brigade. She asks him what he thought and he says it was good but offers no more specific criticism. Rory tells Dean she’ll meet him outside her grandparents’ house at eight-thirty that night, after the party.

When Rory gets to the Gilmore house for the party, Emily sends her upstairs where her hairdresser is waiting for her. Set up with a new hair style, a diamond necklace, earrings and a tiara Rory feels a little silly, but goes down to the party. It doesn't take Rory long before she realizes that all the guests are couples with sons near her age. She asks her grandparents if any of their friends have daughters. They pretend to be baffled at this realization and assure her that they will have another party on another occasion and only invite their friends with daughters.

[[Luke Danes|Luke]]'s sister [[Liz Danes|Liz]] and her husband [[T.J.]] are thinking of buying a house in Star's Hollow. Liz mentions what a great cook Luke is and Lorelai realizes that she's been missing out, so she convinces him to offer her a fabulous dinner. However, before their dinner gets started, T.J. interrupts, upset because of a fight with Liz.

T.J. begs Luke to let him hang out, and then sits on Jess’ bed and cries while telling the couple not to mind his presence. The dinner is further interrupted when Rory calls to tell Lorelai about the party, and even more when Liz comes over to yell at TJ some more. Liz runs into the bathroom and T.J. follows.

Rory tries to have a good time, but gets in the middle of a conversation about cars and it's when a guy begins to flirt with her that Logan arrives at her side, pretending to be her boyfriend.  He and Finn grab some bottles of wine and move the party to the pool house. Rory is having a good time with Logan and his friends until Logan reminds her she needs to choose a man - the entire point of the party.  She says she has a boyfriend and then realizes she’s late meeting him. She goes out front to meet Dean and is followed by the guys. She tries to make him feel better by complimenting his new shirt and saying that the party was lame - despite her blushing cheeks and glances back at the front door - Dean tells her he doesn't belong in her world and gets into his truck. She starts crying and Logan tells her it’s going to be okay. He and his friends take her back to the pool house and promises to cheer her up.

After getting home from a disaster date at Luke's Lorelai calls her for organizing the party where it is obvious what their intentions were. Lorelai hears a car pulling up and becomes upset when she looks out the window to see a tipsy, giggling Rory getting out of a limousine with guys.

What's the very best thing for a broken heart? An engagement! With the Gilmore girls not talking (who would have thought!), Luke provides despondent Lorelai with a much-needed happiness boost.

==Plot Outline==
Picking up on the same night as last season's finale, [[Lorelai]] and [[Luke |Luke]] begin making plans for their future, but Luke is embarrassed when word spreads that Lorelai was the one who proposed. Still hurt over [[Rory]]'s decision to drop out of Yale and move in with [[Emily |Emily]] and [[Richard]], Lorelai tells her parents that they can take care of Rory from now on. Richard hires an old friend and respected attorney to help Rory get an easy sentence for stealing the yacht, but the judge gives Rory 300 hours of community service. [[Logan |Logan]] throws Rory a &quot;felon&quot; party.

Rory gets community service, complete with vest, trash spear, and big orange bag. Lorelai gets a dog. She also gets major renovations on her house when wannabe contractor T.J. helps out...with a sledgehammer.

==Plot Outline==
[[Rory]] sits in the orientation for her community service. [[Lorelai]] adopts a dog, despite [[Miss Patty|Patty]]'s objections. Rory is unable to keep herself occupied and ends up helping the maid, to Emily's horror. [[Luke]] and Lorelai discuss moving into the Twickham house but when Luke mentions selling Lorelai's house, Lorelai tries to think of reasons to keep her house, even though they won't be living in it. The next day, Lorelai comes home to find Luke, George, and Saul evaluating the house for an extension to the upstairs bedroom. Luke tells Lorelai that with an enlarged bedroom and bathroom they can live there and forget about the Twickham house. Rory goes to her community service, picking up garbage. Later that night she goes to visit Luke at the diner. The conversation is awkward and Luke tells her that he and Lorelai are engaged. Rory is very hurt and leaves.

Sookie creates a S'mores wedding cake, so what more does Lorelai need to set a date? Logan comes home, Lane and the band come home, and Paul Anka eats three pounds of chocolate while under Luke's care.

==Plot Outline==
[[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and [[Luke Danes|Luke]] observe [[T.J.]] working as &quot;contractor&quot; on the extension while [http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/Tom Tom] - the actual contractor - follows close behind correcting the orders he gives and attempts to keep up the pretense. [[Paris Gellar|Paris]] and Lorelai have lunch at the [[Dragonfly Inn]]. Afterwards, Lorelai is met with complaints about Paris from [[Michel Gerard|Michel] and [[Sookie St. James|Sookie]] 's and concedes that she will have to cut Paris off. Sookie asks about the date of Lorelai's wedding, and Lorelai explains that once the work on her house is finished she will set the date. Later, when T.J. returns from a pointless errand he has been sent on by Tom, he begins suggesting possibilities for Rory's room, causing Lorelai to look increasingly troubled and tell him to leave it alone. At her next lunch with Paris, Lorelai bombards her with questions about Rory's job.

That evening, Lorelai asks Luke to look after [[Paul Anka]] while she calls in at work. T.J. returns having discovered that he is not really the contractor on the job, quits and proceeds to drown his sorrows in milkshakes at [[Luke's Diner|Luke's]]. Luke reassures him about his skills as a craftsman. Upon going upstairs to his apartment Luke finds that Paul Anka has eaten cooking chocolate and immediately rushes him to the house of the town's vet. The next morning Luke explains the eventful night he spent looking after Paul Anka to Lorelai. She tells Luke that she doesn't want to set a wedding date until things are right with Rory, and he agrees.

Meanwhile, over breakfast at the [[The Gilmore House|Gilmore house]], [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] discusses a mutinous member of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_of_the_American_Revolution D.A.R.] with [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]. Rory agrees to keep an eye on the woman, Constance, while she is at work. By now well into her 300 hours of community service, Rory seems to be flourishing in her litter-picking duty, conversing jovially with the other members of the team and the supervisor. Later, Rory is at work in the D.A.R. office as Emily arrives to see her and Rory shares some gossip about Constance. Rory then receives a call from Paris who tells her that she needs to put down a deposit on their place off-campus. Rory reaffirms that she is not returning to Yale. Rory later supervises a dance class at the old people's home and [[Logan Huntzberger|Logan]] calls in to visit having returned from a trip to Europe. Later, the two talk at the Pool House and Logan hesitates to mention Yale starting back up again, and Rory tells him that the topic of Yale can never be off limits. They eat breakfast on campus the next day and discuss Rory's experiences in a soup kitchen. Logan leaves for a meeting and Rory watches the Class of 2009 arrive. That afternoon, she is inducted into the Hartford branch of the D.A.R.

[[Hep Alien]] play the last concert of their tour at Whinfield Seventh Day Adventist Church, Massachusetts. The band are buoyed by their performance, with [[Gil]] describing them as 'tighter than the Foo Fighters'. An hour out of Star's Hollow, the band all lament how hungry they are. [[Lane Kim|Lane]] makes a confession to the boys, that she has been hiding their earnings from the tour. They have made over $9,000 - enough to make a record.

Rory's World War II-themed DAR bash is a pipperoo (even when suddenly impoverished Paris joins the proletariat as a server). But the bash goes smash when Richard confronts Mitchum Huntzberger.

==Plot Outline==
[[Lorelai]] needs [[Richard]]'s help with her insurance after a small fire at the [[Dragonfly Inn]] and uses the occasion to talk to him about the fact that he didn't manage to get [[Rory]] back into Yale. Although he doesn't appreciate Lorelai's reprimand, Richard has to admit that Rory is not where she should be. Meanwhile, Rory organizes a fabulous DAR party for [[Emily]], but the evening doesn't turn out as planned when Richard confronts [[Mitchum Huntzberger]], [[Logan]]'s father, about his opinion on Rory's journalistic talents. At the same time, Emily has an even uglier confrontation with Logan's [[Shira Huntzberger|mother]] about Rory and Logan's relationship. In addition, [[Miss Patty]]'s 28th annual dance recital is on Thursday night, and Lorelai decides that [[Luke]] should participate in activities he likes, such as camping and fishing, instead of going to things he hates (like dance recitals) with Lorelai. [[Paris]] gets her first job.

Both Rory and Lorelai are saddened by the fact that their estrangement is keeping them apart on Rory's 21st birthday. [[Emily]] takes it upon herself to plan a party for her granddaughter when Rory shows no interest in the event. Richard and Emily find out that Rory and [[Logan]] have been sleeping together.

[[Christopher Hayden|Christopher]], [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and [[Georgia Hayden|Gigi]] head to Paris to bring Gigi to see her mother, [[Sherry Tinsdale|Sherry]], who left in Season 5 to accept a job offering in Paris. Christopher notes that Lorelai was very good with Sherry at the airport, and she was very good with Gigi on the plane.

Christopher packs the car, refusing to tell Lorelai and Gigi what time the plane leaves. Lorelai tells Gigi that Paris is called the &quot;City of Love&quot; because it has lots of love and pigeons, but nobody would want to go and visit the &quot;City of Pigeons.&quot; When they get in the car, Chris tells them they can go get a coffee because the plane does not leave for three hours. Lorelai and Gigi laugh and say they knew it.

[[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] ends her job as Editor-in-Chief of the [[Yale Daily News]] and becomes unsure of what she wants to do with her life. Should she go to Grad School or become a journalist? [[Olivia]] and [[Lucy]] suggest a girls night out in [[Stars Hollow]], so they go there and look through scrapbooks of Rory's past, including past boyfriends. Lucy talks about her boyfriend. When they all get back home to Yale, Lucy's boyfriend [[Marty]] is in the apartment and she introduces Rory to him. Marty is Rory's old friend, and much to Rory's shock, Marty pretends not to know her.

Despite jet lag, Chris and Lorelai have a romantic time. They get engaged and married in Paris, after Chris pops the question during dinner. (Many fans have pointed out that because of legal reasons, they would have not been able to get officially married in a foreign country so quickly; the issue has not been dealt with on the show.)

[[Lane]] and [[Zack]] find out that not only are they pregnant but pregnant with twins. They tell [[Mrs. Kim]] but they are so shocked by her calm and happy attitude towards the pregnancy, that Zach accidently agrees that they would move in with her. They both realize that they are going to be parents and that they make the rules. They then confront Mrs. Kim and tell her that they do not want to move in with her. But Mrs. Kim decides that she is going to move in with them instead.

Rory writes Lucy a letter to explain and apologize for the disastrous double date in which Logan informed her that Rory already knew Marty, Lucy's boyfriend. Paris, sensing that this issue is interfering with Operation Finish Line, confronts Lucy about the situation in the Yale cafeteria. Rory and Lucy make amends, much to Paris's relief.

Jackson and Sookie have scheduled a ski trip and when they come back home earlier than expected, because of a moody and self conscious Sookie, Lorelai comments that Sookie may be pregnant again. Jackson confesses that she may be because he didn't get the vasectomy his wife told him to get.

While installing the new plasma television and looking for a level, Christopher finds the letter that Lorelai wrote as a character reference for Luke's custody battle.

==Character Reference Letter==
The character reference letter was written by Lorelai. It is dated January 9, 2007 and was read aloud by the judge in the case that Luke ensued for custody of April. It has become one of the most popular and heartfelt moments in the Gilmore Girls episodes.

''To whom it may concern, ''

''In the nearly ten years that I have known Luke Danes I have come to know him as an honest and decent man. He’s also one of the most kind and caring persons I have ever met. ''

''I’m a single mother and I raised my daughter by myself. But once Luke Danes became my friend in this town, I never really felt alone. Luke and I have had our ups and downs over the years, but through it all his relationship with my daughter Rory has never changed. He’s always been there for her no matter what. He was there to celebrate her birthdays, he was there cheering her on at her high school graduation. Luke has been a sort of father figure in my daughter’s life. ''

''With his own daughter Luke wasn’t given the opportunity to be there for her first twelve years, but he should be given that opportunity now. Once Luke Danes is in your life, he is in your life forever.''

''I know from personal experience what an amazing gift that is and not to allow him access to his daughter would be to seriously deprive her of all this man has to offer, and he offers so much. Thank you for your time.''

''Sincerely, Lorelai Gilmore''

[[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] is in the hospital recovering from his bypass surgery and will be discharged soon. [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] decides that she will return to [[Yale]]. [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] also decides to return to the [[Dragonfly Inn]]. On her return she discovers that [[Michel Gerard|Michel]]'s beloved dog [[Chin-Chin]] has died. Lorelai is then forced into planning a funeral to make Michel feel better. As [[Sookie St. James|Sookie]] and Lorelai try to plan the funeral Michel decides that they are not working hard enough. As Michel is yelling at them [[Christopher]] appears after not being there for Lorelai while her father was undergoing surgery. They have a short talk but nothing is resolved and they agree to talk later.

Back at Yale, Rory meets the attractive TA that is taking over her grandfather's job while he is recovering. Rory, both when she meets him and when she runs into him in the book store, is flustered and inarticulate. This crush worries Rory, especially in light of [[Paris Gellar|Paris]]'s earlier comments in the dorm of how she has &quot;broken&quot; [[Logan Huntzberger|Logan]]. Rory explains it all to Logan and he comforts her, tell her that it is normal and she hasn't broken him.

Back in [[Stars Hollow]], [[Christopher Hayden|Christopher]] and Lorelai speak again at their home. A reoccurring fear of Christopher's is brought up again, that Lorelai is not over [[Luke Danes|Luke]], to whom she was once engaged. Again nothing is accomplished and they agree to talk later.

Lorelai still has the funeral to deal with, and back at the inn she talks with Sookie about her relationship with Christopher and her relationship with Luke. Lorelai wants to cut Luke out of her life, but Sookie wants to know if without the Luke breakup, would Christopher be the one? Lorelai is unable to answer her.

Later that night Christopher and Lorelai talk once more in the living room, and after a short time Lorelai cries over how she wants to be married to Christopher, but she just doesn't feel the same way about him that he feels about her. Though they do not yet get a divorce, their marriage is over.

==Summary==
Lorelai has a hard time confessing to Emily about her failed marriage to Christopher. When she finally does, she encounters sympathy from Emily, much to her surprise. Rory surprises a Gilmore-ish themed party for Logan's twenty-fifth birthday to show him that birthdays can be fun - this includes ice skating, pinatas and other activities based on the themes that Lorelai had used for Rory's past birthday parties - as opposed to the Huntzbergers' way of throwing birthday bashes. Before going skating, Logan receives a call from his business partner informing him that his company's patents are invalid. He decides quickly not to tell Rory about this.
==Trivia==
*The gas station Lorelai knows about is the same one mentioned in [[French Twist]].
*First time the Gilmores don't serve alcohol at Friday night dinner.

==Summary==
Lorelai plans a road trip to North Carolina to attend the wedding of Mia, the woman who took in Lorelai and Rory and served as a surrogate mother/grandmother for many years. Rory has a fight with Logan over his immature reaction to his business disaster, and agrees to go on the trip with Lorelai. Emily invites herself along in an effort to get away from Richard, who is driving her crazy while he recuperates at home. At the wedding, Emily is upset by the close relationship Mia shares with Lorelai and Rory. Lorelai learns that Emily came to see Mia five years earlier to ask for pictures of Lorelai and Rory during the years they were estranged. Logan makes a surprise appearance and asks Rory to forgive him. Meanwhile, Lane and Zach ask Luke to be the godfather to their twins. Finally, Lane goes into labor and Luke helps get everyone to the hospital.
==Trivia==
*When Rory went outside to talk to Logan with her cake, Logan said you didn't have to bring me cake. It is reminiscent of [[You Jump, I Jump, Jack]] when Logan found Rory alone during the LDB party.

==Plot==
After [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]'s rejection at the New York Times, Rory sends out multitudes of resumes and plans a roller coaster vacation with [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]]. Rory still feels bad about the breakup with [[Logan Huntzberger|Logan]], but Lorelai reassures her the pain will decrease in time. Meanwhile, Lorelai figures her shot with [[Luke Danes|Luke]] has come and gone. Luke meets with his sister, [[Liz Danes|Liz]], and tells her the same. He did, however, previously pick out an extra necklace, as a backup for his present for Rory, and Liz notes it really is for Lorelai.

Since the townspeople of [[Stars Hollow]] couldn't come to Rory's graduation, they have decided on a reenactment next week. Unfortunately, it isn't to be, because Rory does get a job after all, covering Barack Obama and she starts in three days.

The reenactment is canceled, but Luke soldiers on to throw a graduation party, for Rory and to please Lorelai.

When it becomes clear that rain will ruin the party, Luke refuses to give up and creates makeshift tents.

The whole town shows up to bid farewell to Rory. [[Kirk Gleason|Kirk]] has even made a sash for her.

Lorelai thanks [[Sookie St. James|Sookie]] for the party, but Sookie tells her Luke was responsible for it. Lorelai thanks Luke, and he tells her he just wanted to see her happy. They kiss.

It's early in the morning, and the Gilmores Girls stop at [[Luke's Diner]]. Without any direct comment, Rory picks up on that Lorelai and Luke are once again together and Rory is happy. Luke quietly prepares their orders in the background.

==Notes==
*Rory's hero, [[Christiane Amanpour]], guest stars.
*The final scene of the series echoes the final scene of the first episode, where the camera pulls out from Luke's diner and into the street.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2744">Gilmore Girls opens with a cold open, followed by the opening credits.  The credits have changed in minor ways throughout its seven seasons.  Some of these changes are due to cast members being added or being raised to featured status.  Some are simply cosmetic changes.

[[File:Lukeandlorelai.jpg|thumb|left|Lorelai and Luke, in Luke's Diner.]]
'''Luke's Diner''' is the place where the citizen's of [[Stars Hollow]] often go to eat. It is owned by [[Luke Danes]], who is known to have said that he finds feeding people somewhat disgusting. The service also highly depends on his mood of the day. On really bad days, it is downright dangerous to be there, like for example during the days when [[Lorelai]] was about to get married to [[Max Medina]] or during the difficult divorce proceedings between Luke and his ex-wife [[Nicole Leahy]]. People have been seen to be rather violently shown the door after a small complaint. There is a &quot;No cell phones&quot; sign above the counter which Luke strictly enforces.

Other than that, the diner is the place to hang out and get good food. Lorelai and [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] are particularly fond of the place, and eat many a burger and fries there, while exchanging witty banter and on occasion making fun of Luke, who, again depending on his mood, grudgingly goes along with it or walks away. Luke is also their main supplier of coffee.

The diner is also the place where Lorelai [[A House Is Not a Home|asks Luke to marry her]], sitting on the table to the right of the entrance.

Kirk also drove a car through the front window of the diner in [[7.01]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1260">'''Stars Hollow High School''' is the high school of [[Stars Hollow]].[[File:235456256_3fb53c7be6_b.jpg|right|282px]]

Their school colors are red and white, and the teams are the Minutemen. [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] attended Stars Hollow High before she attended [[Chilton Preparatory School|Chilton]]. [[Lane Kim|Lane]], [[Dean Forester|Dean]], and [[Jess Mariano|Jess]] attended as well. Stars Hollow High was where [[Luke Danes|Luke]] attended high school, where he lettered in track. His track team went to State on several occasions, a sticking point with Luke who doesn't feel track gets as much publicity as it deserves, especially in comparison to the hockey team, of which Dean is a member. Stars Hollow High says the Pledge of Allegiance in 6 different languages.

Through a sign outside of the school, the pilot establishes the school as &quot;Division Champs, 1997-98&quot;, and hallway signs indicate that the school has a French club. There is also a small German club, but according to Rory, two of the three members left to join the French club after seeing ''Schindler's List''. Typical of many high schools, the school also has a marching band and a cheerleader squad, both of which Lane is a member of in her time at the school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1697">Interior Decoration plays an important role in the show to flesh out the characterization of the inhabitants of [[Stars Hollow]], [[Hartford]], [[Yale]], and elsewhere.  What living spaces each character chooses, and how they choose to furnish and decorate it gives insight into their personality.  In most cases, these elements merely remains in the background, but often they are directly commented upon.

==Lorelai==
[[Lorelai]] likes kitschy items, but also maintains a comfortable space.  Form outweighs function in many cases, as when her blue, fuzzy alarm clock turns out to be unreliable on [[Rory]]'s first day at [[Chilton]] (ep. [[1.02]]).

In another instance [[Emily]] asks Lorelai where are the elegant candlesticks she gave her, and Lorelai informs her she returned them and bought a monkey lamp instead, which Emily considers pornographic (ep.[[1.09]]).

==Rory==
Rory keeps her room tidy, and has some stuffed animals.
==Lane==
[[Lane]]'s bedroom at her mother's house epitomizes the double-life she is forced to live by her strict mother, [[Mrs. Kim]].  On the surface, she is an obedient Korean girl, but her closet hides her American teenager side, complete with red lights and a disco ball, and secret panels built into the floorboards hide her CDs.
==The Gilmore house==
Meticulously cleaned, well-furnished, and uncomfortable, [[Emily]]'s house's interior is structured and orderly and symmetric.
*While preparing for Rory's party [[1.06]], Emily is insistent that the decorating staff keep the candles exactly six inches apart.

==Luke==
[[Luke]] lives above his diner, and his space lacks any thought to how things look.  [[April]] improves matters after a trip to Target.</text>

On the first day he gives her a massive notebook of last week's notes and suggests she get a copy of another students' notes, which are usually more detailed.  He appears in only one episode, [[1.02]].

'''Drella''' (portrayed by [[Alex Borstein]]), is the rude harpist hired at the [[Independence Inn]] who appears in the first four episodes of the first season of the Gilmore Girls. She is rude to guests, stops at the very end of songs because the kitchen is calling her name, runs over [[Michel]]'s foot with her harp, and plays Black Sabbath if she thinks no one is listening. She also refuses to play requests on principle, but quickly drops the pretense of principles when offered an extra hundred dollars.

He dies of a heart attack two weeks before Rory and Paris' sophomore year of Yale begins. ([[5.03]]) He was teaching a Shakespeare class in Oxford when he had the heart attack. He left Paris an eighteenth-century printing press, which she breifly stored in the common room she shared with Rory.

Rory and Lorelai as well as other townspeople are seen shopping there often throughout the series. The business is owned by [[Taylor Doose]], town Selectman.

[[Dean]] Forester gets a job there on the advice of [[Miss Patty]]. This causes complications for Rory, when they are broken up in the first season, as she can no longer shop there. Lots of drama occurs in Doose's, including many Rory and Dean scenes among others. [[Kirk]] also works there for a short period, and is introduced in Season 1, episode 5 as the Assistant Manager, telling Miss Patty that she can't sample produce. Miss Patty is revealed to be one of the shops most frequent costomers. 

Taylor is protective of his business throughout the series complaining on several occasions when he believes it threatened. It is the only grocery store in Stars Hollow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="810">'''Friday night dinner''' is the weekly dinner meeting of [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]], [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]], [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] and [[Rory Gilmore]] in the [[The Gilmore House|Gilmore Mansion]]. It was originally a requirement of the loan Emily provided Lorelai for Rory's [[Chilton Preparatory School|Chilton]] tuition. According to Emily, if she was going to be financially involved in Lorelai's and Rory's life, she wanted to be personally involved in their life as well. Rory seems to adjust quickly to the commitment, Lorelai, on the other hand, bristles at attending.

The dinner frequently becomes a platform for airing current grievances on both sides, sometimes ending in shouting matches. Lorelai often ends up being utterly exhausted by the end of the dinner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1080">The '''Battle of Stars Hollow''' was an event in [[Stars Hollow]] history, when, on frigid November night in 1776 or an undetermined month in 1779, twelve [[Stars Hollow]] militiamen risked their lives awaiting the redcoats in the [[town square]]. The town takes great pride in this, despite that the British army never showed up. [[Luke Danes|Luke]] seems to be the only one with serious objections to reenacting the &quot;battle&quot; each year, since nothing actually happened. Later (ep. [[Women Of Questionable Morals|5.11]]) it is revealed that a prostitute sympathetic to the colonists delayed a general overnight, allowing Lafayette to attack the British troops. Several townspeople have taken part in a yearly reenactment including Luke's deceased father and Luke's deceased uncle, [[Taylor Doose|Taylor]], the [[Mayor Harry Porter|Mayor]], [[Kirk Gleason|Kirk]], and [[Andrew]]. Despite the historical significance the event has for the townspeople, there seem to be several discrepancies between the accounts of the &quot;battle&quot; between season one and five.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="632">Gilmore Girls was filmed at Warner Bothers Studio, at 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, CA.  It is unclear if it is still dressed as [[Stars Hollow]], as it reused for different films and television shows.  Most of exteriors are filmed on what the studio calls &quot;Midwest Street&quot;, a set built in 1946.  Some scenes from Dukes of Hazzard and Friends have been filmed on this set as well.

'''Paul Anka (originally named Cocoa)''' is the dog that [[Lorelai]] adopts during her estrangement from [[Rory]] in Season 6 and he remains her dog through Season 7 and presumably into the future. He plays a pretty important role throughout Season 6, because Lorelai treats him in many ways, like a second child. She adopts him from the Petfinder convention Stars Hollow has every year. He is named after the singer Paul Anka for some strange reason.

He is a pretty strange dog, simply because he has many quirks. He won't walk down the front steps without having something be put down first. He is scared of peas, tissue-holders, lint, paperbacks, CD's, framed pictures and popcorn. He doesn't like any of the normal dog toys, like rawhide bones and squeaky toys. He also doesn't like when Lorelai or anyone for that matter watches him eat. He cannot see the leash being put on him, but is fine once it is on. He can also get through doors, somehow.

Morey and Babette take Cinnamon around in a wagon with a covered section, in case she wants her privacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="501">[[Lorelai]] had a '''dollhouse''' while growing up in the [[Gilmore Mansion]], which is kept in her old bedroom.  It is one of the few things that she actually likes from her childhood.  [[Emily]] later threatens to give it away to charity if Lorelai doesn't take it from her immediately, but [[Richard]] delivers it to her house so he can talk to her about [[Rory]].  While [[Jackson]] is staying at her house to avoid catching the chicken pox, he accidentally breaks it.

[[Rory]] is given a '''Bracelet''' by [[Dean]] for her birthday. It becomes a symbol of their relationship, and Dean gets very upset one day when Rory is not wearing it ([[2.15]]). Rory had lost the bracelet (but did not notice until Dean points out it is missing) while having a picnic with [[Jess]] in [[2.13]]. Jess finds it and picks it up, but makes no mention of it to Rory. [[Lorelai]], seeing Rory upset about Deans reaction to the missing bracelet, finds out that Jess has it and confronts him about it ([[2.15]]).

When [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] wakes up after [[Logan Huntzberger|Logan]] has gone to London, he finds he left her a model '''rocket ship''' as a gift (ep. [[The Long Morrow|7.01]]). She pretends she understands the reference, but only later finds out that it is a reference to an old Twilight Zone episode, called The Long Morrow (also the title of this episode). The rocket ship is symbolic because it is about a man waiting his whole life for someone, as he was going to wait for her while in London.

When Logan calls to see if she likes the gift, she feigns that she understands the reference but she, along with Lorelai, are utterly confused. Rory ends up spending the whole day researching into rockets on the internet until she finally stumbles upon someone in a forum who recognizes the rocket, informing her of the exact reference and Rory soon adores it.

As it turns out, the rocket refers to a past moment in their relationship (which has not been depicted on the show) where she and Logan are watching an episode of The Twilight Zone from 1964 called 'The Long Morrow'. The episode is about an astronaut named Douglas Stansfield who is sent on a space expedition 114 light years from Earth which will take 40 years. However, prior to that, he falls in love with a woman named Sandra Horn but is distressed that when he returns, she will be 40 years older, and he will remain the same due to him being in suspended animation for the trip. He leaves tragically for the expedition, heartbroken, but it is revealed that during the trip, he turned off the suspended animation to be the same age as Sandra, unaware that Sandra has put herself in suspended animation to remain youthful with him.

This gets through to Logan as the man willingly wasted 40 years of his life to become a 80 year old man just to spend his last few years with Sandra to which Logan comments, &quot;That's true love&quot;. The episode is Logan's favorite episode of the series and Rory now completely understands that Logan gave her the rocket to let her know she is his true love and that regardless how far apart they are, he will always wait for her, to which she gleefully adores and swoons about to Lorelai after much research on Logan's mysterious gift.

Strangely enough, even after their break-up shortly after Rory's graduation, the rocket can still be seen in Rory's possession, giving hope to fans of the couple that Logan wasn't the only one who believed their relationship was true love.

      <comment>add 2nd family guy ref</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3990">*In an episode of ''Family Guy'', Lorelai and Rory are depicted talking really fast and end making out with each other.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''TV''': ''We now return to &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Rory''': ''Mom, I need to talk to you about Dean.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lorelai''': ''Which Dean? Howard Dean, James Dean or Jimmy Dean?''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Rory''': ''Uh, too old, too dead and too fattening.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lorelai''': ''You don't have to tell that to my thighs.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Rory''': ''Can you ask your thighs if they borrowed my Gap Capris?''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lorelai''': ''They did not and are insulted that you'd ask such a thing.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Rory''': ''As insulted as Kitty Kelley when people accuse her of taking liberties with her best selling tell-alls?''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lorelai''': ''Almost. Wanna make out?''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Rory''': ''Absolutely not.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lorelai''': ''Oh, you are so lying.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Rory''': ''I so am.''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In another episode of ''Family Guy'', &quot;From Method to Madness&quot;, (season 3, episode 18) Stewie Griffin claims to have a three-episode guest starring role on the Gilmore Girls as &quot;Rory's motorcycle-driving boyfriend&quot;.
*In the fifth episode of the first season of ''Six Feet Under'', Claire and Ruth are watching the show with some relatives.
*One episode of ''MADtv'' featured a parody of ''Gilmore Girls'' called &quot;The Gabmore Girls&quot; which spoofs its fast talking and feel-good joyfulness by showing them talking fast for long periods of time and then making snow angels.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Rory''': ''Hi, Mom.'' &lt;br /&gt;
'''Lorelai''': ''Rory.  Prodigal daughter.  Fellow sister. Soul mate.  What are you doing back from college?'' &lt;br /&gt;
'''Rory''':  ''We all have dirty laundry in our past.  As it turns out mine is in the present.  No doubt in the future.  But soon, your Maytag willing, once again in my past.'' &lt;br /&gt;
'''Lorelai''': ''See, now, I would have laughed, but I'm not sure what you said is actually funny.'' &lt;br /&gt;
'''Rory''':  ''Anything said quickly can seem wittier than it is.'' &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In an episode of ''Scrubs'' (Episode 517: My Chopped Liver, Season 5), it's revealed that Turk and J.D. watch the show on their night off. After watching the show, Turk calls J.D. over the phone to discuss it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Turk''': &quot;''Mothers and daughters... they speak so fast, but they speak so true.''&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
'''J.D.''': &quot;''I'm so mad at Lorelai, I can't even talk right now.''&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*In another episode of ''Scrubs'' Ted is found hanging upside down in his office. He asks what day it is and when he find out it is Wednesday he says &quot;Oh man! I missed the Gilmore Girls!&quot;
*In an episode of ''Will &amp; Grace'', Jack is talking to Karen about Stan's mistress Lorraine Finster saying &quot;We hate her! We hate her even more than the know-it-all daughter on the ''Gilmore Girls''!&quot;
*In episode 1.02 of &quot;Greek&quot;, Cappie says &quot;How about we all be mature and say what's really on our minds. How the hell could they cancel the Gilmore Girls?!?!&quot;
*In the sixth seasons of ''Girlfriends'' and ''Gilmore Girls'', the shows referenced each other. In ''Girlfriends'', the character Joan Clayton mentions that she lives near a ''Gilmore Girl''. In ''Gilmore Girls'', Lorelai makes fun of Christopher's selection of saved [[TiVo]] programs, one of them being ''Girlfriends''.
*In episode 3.15 of ''Veronica Mars'', Wallace is seen reporting on Logan and Parker's lunchtime tête-à-tête to a bemused Veronica,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Wallace''': &quot;''What?''&quot;&lt;br&gt; 
'''Veronica''': &quot;''I'm just trying to figure out which Gilmore Girl you are.''&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*In the 2006 movie Accepted, the character of &quot;Rory&quot; has a breakdown over not getting into Yale.
*In the 2007 movie Blades of Glory, Will Farrell's character, Chazz Michael Michaels, calls Jon Heder's character, Jimmy MacElroy, and tells him that he taped &quot;The Gilmore Girls&quot; for him.
* In ''Joey'', he once says that he just passed a &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; set and wanted a relationship like that with his mother</text>

However, he still hasn't gotten the hang of the &quot;a little to the right&quot; command yet. He does react to a hand gesture which tells him to turn around and face the wall, though, as seen when Jason and [[Lorelai]] kiss for the first time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="509">'''Buttercup''' is an abandoned dog.  According to her description card, she is a cocker spaniel, golden retriever, bouvier des flandres and rottweiler mix.  [[Lorelai]] temporarily wants to adopt her, but is talked out of it after being reminded of her treatment of [[Skippy the Hamster]].   Buttercup is skittish, her card reads, and tends to react badly towards blonde haired females, brunette males, children of either sex, other animals, red clothing, cabbage or anyone in a uniform.

[[Women Of Questionable Morals|5.11]] (&quot;Women of Questionable Morals&quot;). [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] panics when she sees the dog through the window and calls her then-estranged husband [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]], who is living in the pool house, for help. While trying to find the dog's owner and caring for the lost dog, their relationship starts to mend. While [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] and [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] visit the pool house, Emily is even on hand, watching the dog. Richard shows Emily how to arrange its blanket, and gets her a fresh drink when he sees a dogs hair in it. The Gilmores are confused about the sex of the dog, since it is hairy, but eventually they find out it is female when the owner claims her. Princess is a long-haired Jack Russell Terrier.

They are not close, but Chris is still devastated when he dies in episode [[Women Of Questionable Morals|5.11]]. Straub tried to convince [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] and [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] that [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] should have an abortion when Lorelai found out she was pregnant. However, Emily refused. Straub had limited contact with Rory and in 1.15 said, &quot;I don't care how smart that girl is... she (Lorelai) ruined Christopher's future.&quot;

Straub was an attorney and donated money to worthwhile causes. He and his wife [[Francine Hayden|Francine]] were living abroad and only came back when he became ill.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="424">'''Swan Guy''' is an unnamed character in episode [[1.03]] who delivers the swans to the [[Independence Inn]] for a wedding.  When asked if he has twenty swans when he obviously has only two he sarcastically replies, &quot;Sure, why not?&quot;  He is notable in that he is played by [[Sean Gunn]], and may be another instance of [[Kirk]] before he was given a name.

Taylor Doose spends the entire budget for the Spring Festival on a hay bale maze that shadows the entire town of Stars Hollow. While finding her way to the end of the maze, Lorelai and Luke cross paths and are forced to reunite. Rory and Logan visit the town for the Spring Fair and Lorelai is forced to get to know him by spending time together. Unfortunately, the two have different views about Rory's future. Rory is given a job offer for a newspaper. When she evaluates what she truly wants, she decides to reject the offer and wait on an internship for the New York Times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1125">The festival of living art is yet another one of those crazy festivals [[Stars Hollow]] is hosting.  During the festival, many famous pieces of art are portrayed with actual human beings that are standing still.  At the festival, [[Kirk]] plays Jesus in &quot;The last supper&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci, and takes his role a little bit too seriously, shunning the person who poses as the character of Judas.  [[Lorelai]] is not cast in the festival at first, because [[Taylor]] claims that she flinched while portraying the &quot;Renoir Girl&quot; at the festival seven years before.  Lorelai is very upset about this, and ends up talking Taylor into letting her play the Renoir Girl again, adding that she is the spitting image of said girl. [[Rory]] is recruited by Taylor to play the featured painting that Stars Hollow is adding to the original set of paintings.  During the festival, just as Lorelai is posing as the Renoir girl, [[Sookie]]'s baby pager goes off.  Luckily, Lorelai does not flinch, but as soon as the curtain closes, Lorelai and Rory rush off to meet Sookie.

On many occasions, the people of [[Stars Hollow]] are summoned to the '''town meeting''', where [[Taylor]] informs his citizens of current goings on and conducts polls on important town decisions. The town meeting is often a scene of involuntary comedy (often to the dismay of Taylor, who frequently finds himself at the center of it). The meeting takes place in [[Miss Patty's Dance Studio]].

Trivia

Has signed on for at least 6 episodes of a currently untitled spin-off of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000). The series will focus on the relationship between Jess, his character from &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000), and his estranged father.

The &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000) spin-off (which was to be titled &quot;Windward Circle&quot;) has been canceled due to the high cost of filming on location in Venice, California.

Directed the 2003 and 2004 WB Image Campaigns for popular shows such as &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000), &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; (2003), &quot;7th Heaven&quot; (1996), etc... Some of the WB stars he directed included David Boreanaz, Tom Welling, Kristin Kreuk, Michael Rosenbaum, Jamie Kennedy, James Marsters, Rose McGowan, Allison Mack, Chad Michael Murray, James Lafferty, Beverly Mitchell and 'Reba McEntire'.

When he was seven, his two sisters used to dress him up like Madonna!

After the proposed spin-off series for his character &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000) character Jess fell apart, he chose not to reprise the role as a regular again on the series, citing that he feels that the character has &quot;run his course&quot; [He returned a few times for guest spots].

Didn't have to audition for &quot;The Bedford Diaries&quot;. The WB had Milo, and only Milo, in mind for the role.

The part of Chris Pierce on &quot;American Dreams&quot; was written specifically for him after he met with the show's creators.

Milo and _Heroes_ co-star Adrian Pasdar auditioned for roles in the proposed _Gilmore Girls_ spinoff where Milo was to be the son of Pasdar's character. As there are only 12 years difference between them, the casting director said they would be better off playing brothers. Eight years later, they were playing brothers Peter (Milo) and Nathan (Pasdar) Petrelli in Heroes.

He was with his co-star Ali Larter on the Red Carpet of Golden Globe 2006.

Started a production company named DiVide Pictures (or the Divide Social Club) with 2 childhood friends.

Originally auditioned for the role of Clark Kent in &quot;Smallville&quot; (2001). Although the role went to Tom Welling, the producers at WB liked him so much they gave him the role of Jess on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000).

Personal Quotes

I'm tough on the outside and soft on the inside [...] I'm really a shy guy.

I'm a homebody, I'd rather be in the kichen cooking than hanging out in a bar.

It's [high school] an interesting time in your life because you're trying to act older and mature but you really have no idea what you're doing. You're scared and it's okay to be scared. It's okay to not know completely what you want or what you should be doing and to stumble a little bit.

Every job built my career in some way or made me grow as a person or I got to meet someone great. I had one line on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, but I met Will Smith and he took 20 minutes out of his day to talk to the kid with one line. To this day, I think that guy is amazing because of that.

On the WB holding deal &quot;Basically?yeah! They said, &quot;Here's a lot of money and don't work for anybody else. We don't have anything for you, so you're going to be sitting for awhile.&quot; That was an interesting thing.&quot;

My favorite episode is 'Teach Me Tonight,' the one with the car accident [Jess trashed the car Dean had remodeled for Rory.] Alexis and I were both so tired and laughing and goofing off and having fun, so it was funny for me to watch.

The Godfather&quot; 1 and 2, &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; &quot;The Matrix&quot; -- those are movies I can sit down and watch over and over again,

I just try not to subscribe to the ways of celebrity. I'm not a celebrity, I'm a working actor. A lot of the events -- the parties and the premieres that people go to to get noticed -- I'm just not into. I'll hang out with my friends, go see punk shows, read at home. At the same time, I have a production company, which is a lot of work.

Oh my God. Nothing against the magazines (teen magazines) because they definitely have their purposes, but I don't want to answer questions like &quot;Do you have a girlfriend&quot; and &quot;What is your favorite color&quot;. Answering more adult questions is more intriguing and that's the vibe I'd like to give off.

I'm just a person and I'm not larger than life!

I like to read, too. It's good because Jess carries a book all the time. If it's one I haven't read, I'll sit down and read between takes

I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do anything ... but I bowled like a crazy mouther.

I don't seek attention. If anything I'd rather blend in, remain anonymous.

The kid I play, Jess, moves to town. he's a troublemaker - he steals, drinks beer, smokes. He's seventeen - he shouldn't be doing any of this stuff.

I drive the thing like a granny. I've only gotten one ticket in that car, and it was for an illegal left-hand turn.

I'm sure I'll find something to do. Some kind of trouble to get into.

She is on the Pediatric Hospital Committee with [[Emily Gilmore]] and is good friends with her.

She is a smoker more so when stressed and believes women are born for nothing more than socializing and taking care of house, husband and home that women should not work.

During the first DAR event, Emily and Richard find out that Lorelai wasn't lying when she told them that the Huntzbergers told Rori that she wasn't good enough for their family. So when Emily moves her to a center table she tells her that Rori and Logan will be together and long as they want to. Then in response Shira tells Emily that their money is inadequate compared to theirs. However, Emily calls her a gold digger and asks her what bar she met her husband at, and walks away, leaving Shira embarrassed at the table.

'''Tom''' is a contractor frequently featured whenever there is construction or renovation around town. He first appears in the second season.
==Projects==

Tom's projects throughout [[Stars Hollow]] are as follows:

Season 2:

As a contractor when [[Rory]] performs community service building a house.

Season 3:

- Renovates Luke's property as a joint project for [[Luke]] and [[Taylor]] to expand Luke's apartment and open Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store.

- Attempts to renovate the [[Independence Inn]] after its fire.

Season 4-Season 5:

- [[Sookie]] and [[Lorelai]] use Tom as the contracter when they renovated the [[Dragonfly Inn]] in season 4. As this takes the entire fifth season, he is featured regularly.

Season 6:

- After Lorelai and Luke's engagement, Tom works as the contractor to expand Lorelai's house. Because Luke promised to hire [[T.J.]] as the contractor, Lorelai hires Tom as a second contractor and also pays him more to pretend that T.J. is the real contractor.

Season 7:

- When [[Kirk]] drives Taylor's car into [[Luke's Diner]] while participating in the ceremony of a traffic light camera, Tom fixes and renovates the property.

She also helped [[Lorelai Gilmore]] and [[Sookie]] find the [[Dragonfly Inn]]. In Season 1, Luke fears getting close to her again because she left him before. She apparently gets bored in Stars Hollow and enjoys being in new places. She is a photographer. She leaves Stars Hollow for good in the Season 1 finale, because she believes Luke is in love with Lorelai and she tells him not to wait long.

Lorelai bought this house after she saved enough money from working at the Independence Inn. This is where Rory grew up. The house has two levels, Rory's bedroom downstairs while Lorelai's room is upstairs. Throughout the seasons the house takes quite the beating- it is definitely a house that one would call &quot;lived in&quot;- although it is a very remarkable, clean, nicely decorated house. It received most of its nicks and damages from termites, and GiGi, Christophers daughter. In seasons 5 and 6 Luke and Lorelai renovate the house, sprucing it up and painting it as well, since they are getting married.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2214">'''[[File:Tumblr_lmk298zJSr1qheaxoo1_500.jpg|thumb]][[File:Chad-michael-murray-and-gilmore-girls-profile.jpg|thumb]]Tristan DuGray''' (portrayed by Chad Michael Murray) went to [[Chilton]] with [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] and [[Paris Gellar|Paris]].
==Character History==
He unsuccessfully tries to pressure Rory to date him and obnoxiously calls her Mary, as in the Virgin Mary, a practice common, but dated in catholic schools. Paris, on the other hand, has a crush on him and is jealous of the attention he gives Rory. In episode [[1.13]], we learn that Paris and Tristan have been in the same classes since kindergarten, and he kissed her, on a dare, in sixth grade. Paris also hints he's had a hard life, and his parents weren't that good.

Although Rory rebuffs his attempts, they do share one kiss after a genuine moment at Madeline's party. Upon Rory's advice that he date someone with &quot;a little more substance&quot;, Tristan takes Paris on a date. However, when an angry Paris blames Rory for the date not being anything more, Rory confronts Tristan leading to him asking her, &quot;Is it fair that I date her even though I like someone else?&quot;. Hinting he has a crush on Rory. Rory naively thinks he is referring to his ex-girlfriend Summer and is confused by his exasperation.



In season two, Tristan's father sends him to military school after he, Duncan and Bowman break into his Bowman's dad's safe and the silent alarm 'kicks in'. He's never seen again.

'''The Puffs''' were an elite secret society at [[Chilton]]; there were only ten worth mentioning and the Puffs had been number one for over fifty years. They first appeared in Episode 7 of Season 2. They were lead by former Senior Class President, [[Francie]]. Members include: Sandra Day O'Connor (Leader in 1947 and '48), Francine Jarvis (Leader), Ivy (Francie's spokesperson), Lem (short for Lemon), Dijur, Lily, Celine, Lana, Asia, Anna, Paris Geller, and, temporaily, Rory. Rory joined when she sat down at a random table after being told she was not sociable enough. She was later &quot;kidnapped&quot; by the group and brought to Chilton for a hazing of sorts. Every member of the Puffs was made to recite this peom: I pledge myself to the Puffs, loyal I'll always be, a P to start, 2 F's at the end, and a U sitting in between. They then had to ring the headmaster's historical bell three times.

Hi Wolfgang:

I'm glad someone thought of this before me so I don't have to do all the hard work you have done. :)

When I thought of making a Gilmore Wiki, my main reason was to catalog all the cultural references in each episode. Do you have a template for the episode pages? If you do, it would be cool if we could add a &quot;References&quot; section (although it might be named something else). I am watching the 2005/2006 season now and have started on Season 1, too. I would be willing to start cataloging the references that I &quot;get&quot; but many pass me right by. That's why I think it would be a good idea to add &quot;Cultural References.&quot;

[[User:Rynosoft|Rynosoft]] 05:03, 10 January 2008 (CET)

:: Hi there, there is not really a template for episodes, other than the navigation links on the top and the information box with an image. Feel free to use whatever format you see fit. A &quot;Cultural References&quot; section seems fine to me :) Thanks for contributing and let me know if you need any help. -[[User:Wolfgang|Wolfgang]] ([[User_talk:Wolfgang|talk]])

== Suggestion ==

It might be nice to add some of the links on the [[Main Page]] to the navigation box. I'm thinking of [[Main Characters]] and [[Episodes]], but you could certainly include others.

Ooops, forgot this: [[User:Rynosoft|Rynosoft]] 20:51, 11 January 2008 (CET)

:Hmm, tried to add those two, they do not show up so far. Maybe this and that cache has to clear up. Let's see. -[[User:Wolfgang|Wolfgang]] ([[User_talk:Wolfgang|talk]]) 20:59, 11 January 2008 (CET)
::Meh, it seems some poking around in the PHP scripts is required, I will look at that later maybe :) -[[User:Wolfgang|Wolfgang]] ([[User_talk:Wolfgang|talk]]) 21:02, 11 January 2008 (CET)

:::That's cool. I thought it would be easy but it's not worth it to spend a lot of time on it. [[User:Rynosoft|Rynosoft]] 21:20, 11 January 2008 (CET)</text>

The '''Aerie Girls''' was an advertising campaign for American Eagle that aired during seventh season episodes of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; and &quot;The Gilmore Girls.&quot;  In the spots, a group of teenage girls analyzed the current episode and provided their uniquely adolescent perspective on what they saw.  This stealthly served to sell a line of intimate apparel from American Eagle Outfitters called &quot;aerie&quot;.  It is believed this ad campaign, and the girls in them, were almost universally despised by Gilmore Girls viewers.</text>

      <comment>/* Trivia */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3908">The '''Life and Death Brigade''' is secret society club at Yale that [[Rory]] wrote an article on. It is mysterious and famous for its dangerous stunts. [[Logan]] takes Rory to a couple of the Life and Death Brigade events. Its motto is 'In Omnia Paratus', which means 'ready for anything'.
==Appearances==

Rory first learns of the club in episode 5.06, [[Norman Mailer, I'm Pregnant!]] when she spots a girl a in ballgown and gorilla mask exclaim 'In Omnia Paratus' and climb into a black SUV. Intrigued, Rory does some research and learns that [[Logan]]'s grandfather was in the club, so she conludes that Logan must be as well. She pesters him for an insider interview, but he disclaims any knowledge of the club. Eventually, he offers her a chance to learn more, but only if she agrees to some unknown conditions. 

In episode 5.07, [[You Jump, I Jump, Jack]], Rory finds an envelope stuck to her dorm window with instructions to be in a certain location while blind-folded. Rony then is led by Logan and other members to a mysterious location in the woods that is holding a ''Life and Death Brigade ''event. Everyone at the event is dressed in 1930s style outfits and the tents are vintage safari-style. Rory attempts to question the'' Life and Death'''s'' Brigade ''members, but all refuse to answer her questions, because 1) she wasn't wearing 1930's clothes and 2) becasuse she wasn't complying with the game the members were playing. The members were  conversing only in words that do not contain the letter &quot; e &quot; and refused to answer Rory's &quot;e&quot;-filled questions. The next day, the members partook in bizarre activities like a form of polo with girls in sedan chairs carried by the guys and trap-shooting with paintball guns and human targets who leap onto gym mats. The big event is a leap from a seven-story scaffolding with everyone in formal-wear carrying umbrellas. The safety equipment seems pretty dubious and was apparently tested only on potatoes. However, Logan encourages Rory to be less timid and to become involved in her story for the school paper. Along with four other members, Rory and Logan leap off the scaffolding and in what is a once-in-a-lifetime moment for Rory. After returning from the event, Rory finds at the doorstep of her dorm-room her  earlier confiscated camera, a gorilla mask and a bottle of champagne. This may imply that she is now apart of the Brigade but, her membership is never mentioned nor depicted after this episode.

While members of the Life and Death Brigade appear in several later episodes and is mentioned by [[Mitchum Huntzberger]] while he is explaining his disappointment in Logan, a Brigade stunt is only mentioned again in episodes [[6.18]] and [[6.20]] when Logan, Colin, Finn and Robert plan and improperly execute a stunt in Costa Rica prior to graduation, which causes a serious injury for Logan.

==Known Members==
*[[Logan Huntzberger]]
*[[Colin]]
*[[Finn]]
*Stephanie
*[[Robert Grimaldi|Robert]]
*Seth
*Juliet
*Rosemary

==Trivia==

* &quot;In Omnia Paratus&quot; is also part of the motto of the U.S. Coast Guard.
*In the Brigade Event Rory attends, the members hold a stunt where they jump from a great height wearing formal wear just like the photo she found that she showed Doyle in [[Norman Mailer, I'm Pregnant!]]
*[[Daniel Palladino|Dan Palladino]] based the Life and Death Brigade on a group at Oxford University that spans centuries and actually invented bungee jumping. Dan used the brigade to represent that which could be done when you are smart, witty, and have infinite money at your disposal. The stunts in the episode You Jump, I Jump Jack were based on ideas he got from other outside sources: Dan read a novel where the author attempted to leave out &quot;e&quot;'s; an issue of Vogue from the 1940's featured women in sedan baskets; the first night of the stunt is supposed to look like the movie Out of Africa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1086">Kyle went to [[Stars Hollow High School]] and was good friends with [[Dean]]. He also hosted the party in [[3.19]], behind his parents back. At this party, [[Dean]] and [[Jess]] get in a physical fight after Jess yells at [[Rory]], causing her to cry. Dean and Jess cause a lot of damage to Kyle's house, including breaking a fence. The police break up the party. This party was the main reason Jess left town, causing Rory and him to break up. Kyle's parents found out about the party and Kyle entered the Navy (unclear if this was because of the party itself). Kyle was good friends with Dean, and was part of his bachelor party (when Dean drunkly confesses his love for Rory to [[Luke]]). Dean also moved in with Kyle after [[Lindsay]] and him separated. While Dean lives with Kyle, we found out Kyle was wounded in the Navy and now has a hook for one of his hands. He finds that the hook helps him to meet many women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="700">There are several instances of inside jokes within the Gilmore Girls, some are listed below.
*Dave Rygalsky is said to have left to attend school in California.  Adam Brody, who played the character, left to star in &quot;The O.C.,&quot; which was set in California.
*When Jess shows up again, he says he is now living in Philadelphia.  Milo Ventimiglia was starring in &quot;American Dreams&quot; at the time, set in Philadelphia.
*Brad Langford returns to Chilton after starring in &quot;Into the Woods&quot; on Broadway.  Adam Wylie, in fact, did star as Jack in &quot;Into the Woods&quot; on Broadway between appearances.
*Several references are made to the movie, &quot;Dirty Dancing.&quot;  Kelly Bishop, who plays Emily, starred in that movie.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="959">'''Dula''' is the daughter of [[Liz Danes|Liz]] ([[Luke Danes|Luke]]'s sister) and [[T.J.]] (her husband), born during [[Season 7]].

Liz, gets pregnant with Doula in [[Season 6]], when she freaks out and decides T.J. will be a horrible father, and doesn't want him a part of this new child's life. When Liz tells Luke the news, he flips, but easily fixes the situation when he realizes the root of the problem is Liz's fear of herself as a mother. Liz was unable to handle her first child, [[Jess Mariano]], and she is worried she will fail at motherhood again. Luke comes to the rescue, and Doula is born with a mother and father, into a very happy home.

One of the critical Luke-[[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] moments in season 7 happens when Lorelai meets Liz, Luke and Doula, and holds Doula for a few moments. [[Christopher Hayden|Christopher]] comes into the scene - and it is obvious that he is jealous.

She meets him at the summer student government program in Washington DC. Jamie is a year older than Paris, and goes to Princeton. Paris falls for Jamie quickly because she has never experienced someone loving her as he did. Paris loses her virginity to him in Season 3 and blames him for her rejection from Harvard and blows up at Chilton's Bicentennial. Paris and Jamie stay together for about a season, although their relationship is marginalized. Jamie's character is brought back when Paris begins to have an affair with a Yale professor, [[Asher Flemming]], and Paris strings Jamie along, even though her heart belongs to Asher. Jamie comes to visit Paris at [[Yale]] on his birthday, and Paris breaks up with him, per Rory's advice, and the character of Jamie is never seen again.

He intrudes upon her relationship with Doyle as well as her everyday activities, and drives Paris' roomates crazy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="904">'''Francie Jarvis''' was a student at [[Chilton]], who made her way onto the scene during [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]'s senior year, in season 3. Francie resented [[Paris Gellar|Paris]]' position as president of her class, and tried everything in her power to manipulate the student body government to do what she wanted to do. Paris wanted the senior gift to be a telescope, whereas Francie would rather use the money to have their final dance in a big fancy mansion. Francie's alternative to the telescope as the senior gift was planting a tree in the quad, just as every senior class before them did. Paris was eventually outvoted and lost the battle against Francie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2125">Today, March 14, 2008, the '''Gilmore Girls Wiki''' has been merged with the '''Gilmorepedia''' (previously located at http://gilmorepedia.com/).

This page details aims to answer any questions you may have regarding the current situation.

== User accounts ==
Most SL History users should be able to use their old account names. However, a few usernames were already present in Wikia's shared user database, and so those SL History users had to be renamed during the import. If you find that you cannot login using your old username, please try to use '''GP-[your_old_username]''' and your old password.

== Articles ==
As with users, most articles were simply brought over without any changes. Some, however, already had existing counterparts on Second Life Wikia. These have been renamed and can be found [http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&amp;from=Merge&amp;namespace=4 on this list].

== Reporting bugs and filing requests ==
If you see something wrong or want something changed on the site that the admins cannot do, we're here to help.

When reporting a bug, be sure to give '''at least one example''' of the erratic behavior. This not only makes it easier to identify the problem, but also lets us check if the issue has been resolved correctly, rather than asking you to verify.

Bug reports should go to [[User_talk:TOR|TOR's talk page]] and requests should go to [[User_talk:Toughpigs|Danny]].

== Contact ==
For questions regarding Wikia's policies and the move in general, please contact [[User:Toughpigs|Danny]], Wikia's Community Development Manager. You can reach him by leaving a message on [[User talk:Toughpigs|his talk page]].

For &lt;span id=&quot;technical issues&quot;&gt;technical issues&lt;/span&gt; and problems, the person you're looking for is [[wikia:User:TOR|TOR]]&lt;staff /&gt;, a member of Wikia's [[w:Technical team|Tech Team]].

You can reach TOR by:
* editing [[User_talk:TOR|his talk page]]
* going to the [irc://irc.freenode.net/wikia #wikia] IRC channel and looking for TOR_CNR
* writing to [mailto:tor@wikia.com tor@wikia.com]
He is available weekdays, usually from about 9 AM to 5 PM CET.</text>

If you have any questions or comments, leave them on [[User_talk:Wolfgang|my talk page]].

My favorite episode is [[4.07]] and my favorite character, after the girls and [[Luke]], is [[Jason]]. Just in case anyone wanted to know.

I am, however, mostly retired. Happy editing :)

Please sign your question or comment with &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; (four consecutive tilde characters). This will expand to your username (or ip address, if you are not logged in) and the date/time of your edit. I will do my best to reply on this page as soon as possible.

Wolfgang, how would you prefer to categorize the episodes?  By season/episode number, or alphabetical by title?  My opinion is that we have episodes listed on the main page in numerical order by season.  I also think we should remove episode numbers in the titles (or at least move them to the end), thus allowing the episodes to be listed alphabetically where necessary.  Of course, I leave it up to you.  Thanks!  [[User:JMcKenzie|JMcKenzie]] 07:41, 5 June 2008 (UTC)
:: I think the main categorization of eps should be the episode number/season, because this is the chronology of the show. I am good with removing the numbers from the titles, or writing them in brackets at the end, the only thing that should stay in place is the redirect pages that redirect from episode number to episode page, so that the navigation bar on top of the episodes keeps working. No need to leave it up to me either, as long as we give truthful credit to this great show, let's have a ball :) Incidentally, I don't have much time to edit these days, I can always help out with little things here and there. Just let me know if you need anything. Cheers -[[User:Wolfgang|Wolfgang]] ([[User_talk:Wolfgang|talk]]) 07:53, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

== From Dowsiewuwu ==

Do you still edit here often? I was made the other admin to kind of clean up some things around here while you are away. I am just wondering if you will still be an active admin/bureauc.

Please respond on [[User talk:Dowsiewuwu|my talk page]].

[[User:Dowsiewuwu|Elisabeth Perry, Dowsiewuwu]] 04:00, April 12, 2010 (UTC)

== are you the gilmore girls wiki admin? ==

I am kylekroll. I am another person who is gonna get involved with this wiki. Am I supposed to tell you this?


[[User:KyleKroll|KyleKroll]] 03:03, April 13, 2010 (UTC)

: Hi Kyle! Well I am an admin, because I founded the Wiki and made the initial edits, but not ''the'' admin ;) I am also more or less retired now, and there is a new admin in town (see above). There is no need to tell me anything, but thanks for letting me know anyway. Happy editing :) --[[User:Wolfgang|Wolfgang]] ([[User_talk:Wolfgang|talk]]) 05:46, April 13, 2010 (UTC)
== Ad free ==

Hi! Would you like this wiki to be ad-free? I'm looking for wikis to be part of a new program which would remove all ads from the wiki for $19.95/month.

Hi Danny, and thanks. The thing I most need right now is people who write good articles, mainly episodes and characters ;) Other than that, the images on the episodes and character pages are broken, but Tor promised to fix that.
I think I want to revamp the main page, as it is currently a bit dull. The old main page here does not look too bad actually so I think I will start from there. I will let you know if I need help, my wiki fu does not extend to all that fancy table formatting, I'm afraid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="496">Hello all,

I'm a moderate fan of the Gilmore Girls.  I love the show because everyone on the show is so beautiful.  Who could possible resist those blue eyes.  It's also very rare that a mother and daughter actually look related on TV.

I've watched every episode multiple times, and I only wish I could catch up on all of the cultural references.

I hope to become an active contributor to this wiki, especially since the show is over!

Cheers,

Why would anyone post an engagement announcement with only one person in the picture?  Odd. [[User:Jysung|Jysung]] 16:46, 18 April 2008 (UTC)
:I bet Luke was very vocal in his objections against having his face in the paper ;) [[User:Wolfgang|Wolfgang]] ([[User_talk:Wolfgang|talk]]) 18:33, 18 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

'''Pilot''' is the first episode in season one of Gilmore Girls. 

==Summary==
The series begins when [[Rory Gilmore]] ([[Alexis Bledel]]) is accepted into the elite Chilton prep school and dreams of attending Harvard. This is bad news for her mother, [[Lorelai Gilmore]] ([[Lauren Graham]]), as she must reconcile with her parents [[Emily]] ([[Kelly Bishop]]) and [[Richard]] ([[Edward Herrmann]]) in order to borrow the money for Rory's tuition. Rory meets [[Dean]] ([[Jared Padalecki]]) and has second thoughts about attending Chilton.

==Plot==
Welcome to the small and town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. Home of the Gilmore girls Lorelai and Rory. Lorelai is a 32-year-old single mother who is so close to her daughter Rory that many people mistake them for sisters. The show opens at the local diner that the girls patronize often. Lorelai has a special relationship with the owner and an addiction to caffeine (coffee). She squares off with the owner on a daily basis over just how much coffee she's allowed to have.

We're also treated to an opening scene where an unsuspecting male hits on the both of the Gilmore girls, separately. This creates some of the quirky problems the Gilmore girls have. Clearly, there are hazards in being a mother and daughter pair so close in age.

Later, we meet Lorelai's bizarre staff at the inn she manages. There's Michel, the rude French man who runs the front desk, the unbelievably sassy harp player, and Sookie, the chef who is a walking disaster area.

Meanwhile, we find out that Rory is the kind of girl who is more interested in academic pursuits and reading Madame Bovary than worrying about clothes and boys. But unbeknownst to Rory there is a new guy in town and he has his eyes set on her. Rory and her best friend, Lane, hang out after school and discuss an upcoming teen hayride. Rory wouldn't be caught dead at the event, but Lane has strict parents who are trying to set her up with the son of a business colleague.

The real story is that Rory hears she has been accepted to the exclusive prep school Chilton, which means guaranteed admission to Harvard. Rory is psyched, but Lorelai gets a rude awakening, the school wants a pricey enrollment fee in addition to first semester's tuition. And they want it pronto. Lorelai doesn't have the money, but can't bear the thought of disappointing her daughter. The only thing left for her to do is ask her wealthy parents. But that's not such an easy task since Lorelai's relationship with her parents is beyond strained. As a teenager, Lorelai didn't exactly fulfill her parent's high expectations. (Getting pregnant at sixteen didn't help.) So it is going to take a lot of pride swallowing for her to ask for the money.)

Lorelai does indeed end up asking her folks for money, where she receives quite the chilly reception. When she asks for the money, they agree, since it is really for Rory, but have one minor condition. Lorelai's mother, Emily, demands that she get to see her daughter and granddaughter once a week. That means dinner every Friday night. Lorelai hesitates, but agrees.

At school, Rory is explaining to Lane about Chilton when she bumps into Dean, the new kid from Chicago who has been eyeing Rory. They talk and Rory begins to really like Dean. Just how hard she falls for him isn't revealed until later when she tells her mom that she doesn't want to go to Chilton anymore. Lorelai is confused and astounded, but Rory doesn't back down. When the truth comes out, Lorelai flips out and says she will not allow her daughter to throw her life away for some random guy. Rory is going to Chilton whether she wants to or not.

When the Gilmore girls go to the grandparents' house for dinner, the whole night turns into a big disaster. Lorelai's father starts talking about Rory's dad, Christopher, and all his success he has had with his Internet startup in California. This causes Lorelai to have a mini-breakdown. She and Emily end up fighting in the kitchen and Rory overhears every word, including the part about paying for Chilton. When it's all over, Rory recognizes her mom's bravery and agrees to go to Chilton.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2033">[http://virtualgilmore.squarepins.org Virtual Gilmore] is a project that began in the spring of 2007 by a group of fans at [[Television Without Pity]].  The fans decided that the television show [[Gilmore Girls]] was gone before its time when the show aired its season finale in May 2007.  The group decided to take it upon themselves to continue the plots and characters in story format.  

With '''sosmitten''' as head writer and '''Jenepel''' as producer, the group was off to a running start!

Before long, they had an organized group of fans who brainstormed to figure out what was next for [[Lorelai]], [[Rory]], and the rest of [[Stars Hollow]]'s citizens.  A core group of writers was selected and on a Tuesday night at 8PM (the show's former timeslot on [[The WB]] and later [[The CW]]) in September 2007, episode 8.01 &quot;Into the Great Wide Open&quot; &quot;aired&quot; online.  

The Virtual Season &quot;staff&quot; tried their best to stay true to the original characters and produced 22 &quot;episodes&quot; from September 2007 through May 2008.  The &quot;episodes&quot; was written by one or two people per installment, but the whole staff contributed to each episode, working hard to bring the audience a uniformly written story.

The project was well-received at [[Twop|Television Without Pity]] and less so at [[FanForum]], the latter's posters seemingly fed up with the pace of the relationship between [[Luke]] and [[Lorelai]].  

There was some question when the last episode of season 8 was presented whether the writers would continue to a season 9.  Episode 8.22, &quot;It's All Over But the Crying&quot; was designed so that the story may have continued or may not have; there was no cliffhanger but there was some sense of unfinished business.

In June 2008, the virtual season staff announced they were starting to plan for season 9.  '''Robinpoppins''' and '''Jewels''' would replace '''sosmitten''' in the head writer role (with '''sosmitten''' remaining on staff in a &quot;lead writer&quot; role).  Episode 9.01 (Untitled as of yet) is set to &quot;air&quot; September 30, 2008.</text>

== Hi there ==

Hi, thanks for the heads up. I am not really editing anymore, so I can be considered retired, except maybe reverting blatant vandalism or spam when I spot it. 
Cheers, --[[User:Wolfgang|Wolfgang]] ([[User_talk:Wolfgang|talk]]) 06:22, April 12, 2010 (UTC)

== Bureaucrat ==

I also just upgraded you to Bureaucrat. Seems pointless for me being the only one, and inactive to boot :)
Have fun, --[[User:Wolfgang|Wolfgang]] ([[User_talk:Wolfgang|talk]]) 06:37, April 12, 2010 (UTC)

Hey, hi, hello! My name's Jennifer. You'll probably find me helping out around here by categorizing pages and fixing minor things like spelling mistakes and unhelpful edits. I'm around on other wikis as well, so you may know me from another. Probably not though, because I don't talk too much. Feel free to talk to me, though. See ya around!

==Fun facts==
* The first episode I saw was [[I Can't Get Started]] (oi with the poodles already!).
* I'd initially thought that [[Michel Gerard|Michel]] was a wedding planner.
* And that [[Paris Geller|Paris]] wasn't on [[The Franklin]] staff with [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]].
* I didn't see the cast-removal scene.
* I actually started to watch that episode out of boredom; I was flipping through channels.
* I continued to watch because I saw [[Jared Padalecki]] in it (Supernatural fan here).
* My favorite show moment was when [[Luke Danes|Luke]] pushed [[Jess Mariano|Jess]] off the bridge.

==To-do==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1822">[[File:Lorelai---Alex-gilmore-girls-139988_533_400.jpg|thumb]]Introduced in I Solemnly Swear , Alex is the business partner of an old friend of Sookie's that Lorelai and Sookie run into at the Learning Center after taking a course on how to run an inn. Alex and his friend Joe are looking into opening a chain of coffee shops. While Sookie and Joe reminesce about old times Lorelai and Alex hit it off resulting in him calling her at the end of the episode to ask her on a date to try different types of coffee. On that date in the next episode, Lorelai Out of Water, he says he has two daughters aged 6 and 9, whose mother he is not with anymore. He is also a big fan of the outdoors and upon Lorelai seeming to take an interest, he invites her to go fishing with him, which despite her lack of experience she excepts. Luke teachers her to fish. Though Lorelai doesn't tell him, he senses she has never fished before and as such takes her to the Shehela Lodge and Spa afterwards. The last time we see him is the episode Swan Song in which he acquires 4 tickets to see the musical Levittown in New York and invites Sookie and Jackson to join them. The musical is a bust but the four of them have a good time anyway. Alex is shown to be kind and considerate to Lorelai and her eccentricities. He is mentioned a few times during the rest of the season when Lorelai runs into Max again and feelings resurface for him, she is said to still be dating Alex though we never see him and when or what exactly caused their break up is unclear. {{Infobox character

'''Francine Hayden''' is the mother of [[Christopher Hayden]] and wife (later widow) to the late [[Straub Hayden]]. Her relationship with her son is in no means strong, but it isn't as weak as the relationship Chris holds with his father. It was noted that she and [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] were practically inseparable before [[Lorelai Gilmore|Lorelai]] became pregnant, and the two were close friends. During first appearance, she is shown to be less hostile to Lorelai.

After her husband's death, it's said that she shows up to help Christopher with his daughter, however this is off screen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="282">I wasn't sure where else to put this, but I think there should be a standard way of naming episodes. Right now there seem to be several conventions: the episode number, the episode title, or some combination of both. [[User:Sarahjane10784|Sarahjane10784]] 05:14, July 14, 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="723">'''Pennilyn Lott''' was [[Richard Gilmore]]'s girlfriend while he was a student at Yale. He was engaged to Pennilyn, but broke it off to be with [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]]. [[Lorelai &quot;Trix&quot; Gilmore|Richard's mother]] thought Pennilyn was a much more suitable wife for Richard than Emily, and she wrote Richard a letter begging him to call off his wedding to Emily and reconcile with Pennilyn ([[The Reigning Lorelai|4.16]]). As Emily learns at the Harvard-Yale game ([[Ted Koppel's Big Night Out|4.09]]), Richard and Pennilyn have lunch once a year, which makes Emily extremely jealous.

[[File:Me with Oscar the Grouch.jpg|thumb|300px|Me with my hero: '''[http://grouches.wikia.com/wiki/Oscar_the_Grouch &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Oscar the Grouch&lt;/span&gt;]'''.]]
Hi, I'm &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;T.J.&lt;/span&gt; but you can call me &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Teej&lt;/span&gt;; many people do. I'm a great swimmer, artist &amp; cook &amp; I can imitate the voices of cartoon characters &amp; real people extremely well. I've been able to for, about, most of my life. I am very proud of this incredible talent. '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt;]''' is my favorite color in the world. I also '''LOVE''' the '''[http://grouches.wikia.com/wiki/Grouches &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Grouches&lt;/span&gt;]''' from [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Sesame_Street Sesame Street], my favorite TV show. I love trash as much as they do. I even celebrate '''[http://grouches.wikia.com/wiki/National_Grouch_Day National &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Grouch&lt;/span&gt; Day]''' like the '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Grouches&lt;/span&gt;''' every [http://grouches.wikia.com/wiki/October_15 October 15]th. My favorite '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Grouches&lt;/span&gt;''' of all are '''[http://grouches.wikia.com/wiki/Oscar_the_Grouch &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Oscar the Grouch&lt;/span&gt;]''' &amp; his girlfriend '''[http://grouches.wikia.com/wiki/Grundgetta &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Grundgetta&lt;/span&gt;]'''. Also, if I could I would totally live in a dirty beat up old &lt;span style=&quot;color:Gray&quot;&gt;trash can&lt;/span&gt;. My specialty is gettin rid of redirects w/ the | button. I've gotten rid of redirects with the | key on many other Wikis as well. I'm also an administrator &amp; bureaucrat on the '''[http://grouches.wikia.com/wiki/Grouches_Wiki &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Grouches Wiki&lt;/span&gt;]'''. So if anybody ever has a question about that or anything please feel free to leave a message on [[User talk:GrouchMan|my talk page]] &amp; I'll respond A.S.A.I.C. (as soon as I can).

==&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;The Fictional Me&lt;/span&gt;==
'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;GrouchMan&lt;/span&gt;''' is 1 of the meanest, grouchiest, rottenest [http://grouches.wikia.com/wiki/Grouches &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Grouches&lt;/span&gt;] around. His birth name is '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Oscar the Grouch II&lt;/span&gt;''' named after his uncle, that true rotten legend, '''[http://grouches.wikia.com/wiki/Oscar_the_Grouch &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Oscar the Grouch&lt;/span&gt;]''' of [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Sesame_Street_(location) Sesame Street]. &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Oscar&lt;/span&gt; &amp; his identical twin brother '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Travis the Grouch&lt;/span&gt;''' were extremely popular at Grouch school. He soon became better known as &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;GrouchMan&lt;/span&gt; at school, but he became '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Scar the Grouch&lt;/span&gt;''' after receiving a scar across his left eye after a tragic Grouch petting zoo accident. He mostly goes by Scar nowadays, but, nevertheless, he's still &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;GrouchMan&lt;/span&gt;. At school, &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Scar&lt;/span&gt; also met a Grouch girl who was actually equally grouchy whose name was '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Grundgetta&lt;/span&gt;'''. She became '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;GrouchGal&lt;/span&gt;''' shortly after that. &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Travis&lt;/span&gt;, soon after, met her identical twin sister '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Toxica&lt;/span&gt;'''. Not too long after they graduated Scar &amp; Grungie became Grouch boyfriend &amp; girlfriend, as did their siblings. They call each other Oskie &amp; Grungie, but &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Grungie&lt;/span&gt; still goes by &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;GrouchMan&lt;/span&gt;. However, shortly after graduation, Scar &amp; Travis' parents, '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Oswaldo the Grouch&lt;/span&gt;''' &amp; '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Trashy the Grouch&lt;/span&gt;''', the brother of Oscar &amp; sister of Oscar's girlfriend, '''[http://grouches.wikia.com/wiki/Grundgetta &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Grundgetta&lt;/span&gt;]''', were killed in a terrible car accident. Right after that, both &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Scar&lt;/span&gt; &amp; &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Travis&lt;/span&gt;, immediately moved into their &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Uncle Oscar&lt;/span&gt;'s [http://grouches.wikia.com/wiki/Oscar's_trash_can &lt;span style=&quot;color:Gray&quot;&gt;trash can&lt;/span&gt;] on [http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Sesame_Street_(location) Sesame Street], so now their &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Aunt Grundgetta&lt;/span&gt;, helps &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Oscar&lt;/span&gt; to protect &amp; take amazing care of their orphaned nephews. Now, all &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Scar&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Grungie&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Travis&lt;/span&gt; &amp; &lt;span style=&quot;color:Green&quot;&gt;Toxica&lt;/span&gt; do all day is tell other people to scram &amp; argue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1349">Hi! I'm Nanna :) I'm 17 and from Denmark!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I fell in love with Gilmore Girls after it ended through friends of mine that loved the show. I watched it all from start to finish and loved every second. Sadly, when I came to the series finale, Gilmore Girls was over for me - I had a very short run without long breaks and hiatuses but that doesn't change my love for it! I love how it's different from the usual over-the-top drama-filled shows, or the shows that are just funny and have no continuation. Don't get me wrong, I love those types of shows too, but Gilmore Girls was a breath of fresh air and I am so sad it ever got cancelled!
&lt;br&gt;
I'm on this Wikia to still share some of my love for the show, and though I don't edit as often here because there will be no more new information, I still like to come here every once in a while!

&lt;br&gt;

When Rory would come over to see Cathy to go swimming in their pool, Lorelai had long conversations after she'd drop Rory off at their house. Debbie was also the one that got Lorelai and [[Luke Danes|Luke]] the gig to speak at Stars Hollow High about business and Lorelai told Rory she didn't remember Debbie.

'''Trivia:'''
*[[Andrew]] works here.
*Rory got a job sorting books here later in the series, where she ended up buying alot of books. She stated that the job was 'costing her alot'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="964">'''[[File:Shvideo.jpg|thumb]]Stars Hollow Video''' is the video store in [[Stars Hollow]]. Since [[Lorelai]] and [[Rory]] love watching movies so much, they go there often to rent movies.



'''Trivia:'''
*In the episode [[Kiss and Tell]], Lorelai and Rory rent the movie [http://Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Charlie and the Chocolate Factory], and get junk food from Dooses, where [[Dean]] works, and Lorelai invites him to come watch the movie with them at their house.
*Also, in the episode [[Richard in Stars Hollow]], Rory sees two young boys looking at a 'mature' video cover. She tells [[Kirk]]- who works there at the time- to move the video to a higher shelf. He tells Taylor, and they end up moving all of the videos except for movies such as [http://Dumbo Dumbo] and [http://Bambi Bambi] behind a curtain, and hang Rory's picture in the window for sensorship.

Honor is also seen to smoke cigarettes. 

The Huntzbergers believes that Josh is better suited for that family than Rory. Although, they seem to not like him very much. 

She thinks Rory is very nice and is good friends with her. She tells Rory how sorry she feels about Logan and Rory breaking up when Rory thought that they were still together.

Jess: It’s no misprint.
Rory: You wrote a book?
Jess: A short novel.
Rory: You wrote a book?]]
Truncheon books is a publishing house which is first mentioned in episode 8 season 6, when Jess Mariano turns up at Rory's grandparents house to show her the short novel he wrote called The Subsect, the book was published by Truncheon books.

JESS; I didn’t think you’d believe it if I didn’t show it to you in person. [hands her a book]
RORY; Oh, color me curious. A book. [reads front the cover] The Subsect. Written by Jess Mariano. [she looks at him]
JESS; It’s no misprint.
RORY; You wrote a book?
JESS; A short novel.
RORY; You wrote a book?
JESS; And, through a fluke, I got it to these guys that have a small press and they read it. I don’t know if they were high or something, but they decided to publish it.
RORY; You wrote a book.
JESS; There’s no money in it. They only printed, like, five hundred of them. Believe me, I’m not quitting my day job.
RORY; But - you wrote it. You wrote a book.
JESS; Yeah, I know, it’s hard to believe.
RORY; You sat down and wrote a novel. Jess This is amazing!

The owners/founders of Truncheon books (who are seen) are Chris and Mathew, Jess joins the company later, But you don't actually see Truncheon books until episode 18 season 6, where they host an open house and Jess invites Luke, April and Rory. He is surprised at Luke's appearance and even more so when he meets his cousin. Luke asks Jess to give him a tour

JESS; This is where we work: Truncheon Books. There's usually desks and crap piled up everywhere but we cleaned up for today. Those are the books that we put out. We publish our 'zine once a month, except last August when my partner forgot to pay the printer. We let local artists hang their stuff up without ripping them off on commissions, we do performances over there, and a few of us live upstairs, and that you don't want to see. It's a disaster zone.


In this same episode, in truncheon books, Rory and Jess kiss, but Rory confesses that she is in love with Logan and that she only came because she was angry at Logan for cheating on her. Jess tells her that she can tell Logan that something happened if it will make her feel better. And we never see Truncheon books again...</text>

Okay I don't know how the 4 tildes are supposed to sign anything and stuf but I just wanted to say that saying Fans hate him for not being loved by Rory or not being Logan is ultra bitchy. Seriously. Sure Marty isn't all that interesting but Logan is an ass and the worst boyfriend Rory has over the whole show.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4021">[[Rory|Rory Gilmore]] and [[Jess Mariano]] had a complicated relationship

Jess's mother, Liz, sent Jess away to Stars Hollow, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut Connecticut] to live with her brother, [http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/Luke_Danes Luke Danes]because she couldn't handle him and thought that Luke could. But Jess's arrival in Stars Hollow wasn't well received by the town at large. Luke has an even bigger problem controlling Jess's personal life while he's in Stars Hollow. Despite his actions, Jess's knowledge of books and pop culture eventually appeal to Rory Gilmore. They become friends despite others' disapproval, and Jess pursues Rory, despite her relationship with Dean. Jess leaves town for a while following a car accident which leaves Rory injured. Rory skips school to visit him in New York, where they officially say goodbye. Jess and Rory officially start dating after the local dance marathon when Dean tells Rory he knows she is interested in Jess and breaks up with her. Their relationship runs into trouble because of both Jess's and Rory's constant insecurities and difficulties communicating. Rory later confesses to her friend Lane Kim that, while she was initially attracted to Jess due to their similar interests, she was ultimately too used to Dean's affection and reliability, expecting Jess to treat her the same, only to realize that he never would. When Luke finds out that Jess would not be allowed to graduate from Stars Hollow High because he had cut too many classes, he tells Jess that he must repeat his senior year or leave. Unwilling to accept Luke's stipulations, Jess goes to Calfornia to live with his father. 
[http://images.wikia.com/gilmoregirls/images/3/38/Big_alexis_bledel_milo_ventimiglia_una_mamma_per_amica.jpg]Rory &amp; JessAdded by [http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com/wiki/User:P_Sawyer P Sawyer]Jess briefly returns to Stars Hollow in season four to steal back his car from Luke after his mom tells him Luke stole it from him nearly a year earlier. Jess also sees Rory several times, though every encounter ends with him giving her the cold shoulder. Jess leaves after telling her that he loves her. A few months later, Jess returns to Stars Hollow for his mother Liz's wedding. After the wedding, Jess visits Rory at Yale and asks her to run away with him. She declines. Two years later, a much more mature Jess returns to deliver a copy of the book he has written to Rory, explaining his new life working at an independent publishing company, and explaining that he could not have achieved any of his recent success had she not believed in him when they were teenagers. At the time, Rory had dropped out of Yale and moved into her grandparents' house. They decide to get something to eat, but are interrupted by an agitated Logan, who invites himself along. During the reunion, Logan treats Jess ironically in the same way Jess's has teased Dean in the past; he is condescending and arrogant. Jess walks out amid an argument with Logan. Although Rory goes after him, Jess refuses to stay. He is shocked that Rory is dating someone like Logan, and more importantly that she has dropped out of school with no plans for the future, and repeatedly demands to know what's going on, telling her &quot;this isn't you, Rory, you know it isn't.&quot; His criticism and refusal to accept excuses make Rory take a serious look at her life and are instrumental in her return to Yale. He then says this is a bad time for them to meet up, so he'll see her another time. Jess appeared for the final time in the Season 6 episode &quot;The Real Paul Anka&quot;, where he, Luke and Rory meet again at the new book store/art gallery/publishing house in Philadelphia where Jess works. Rory and Jess exchange a kiss, but Rory tells Jess that she is still in love with Logan and only did it because she found out Logan had been with someone else while they were broken up. Jess is hurt at being used, but says that she can tell Logan something happened. After that he is never mentioned again.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="522">So I've been using this wiki pretty extensively while re-watching each season in order to make a list of books seen and referenced in the show, and I've just started season five and noticed that only the first few episodes have book/music/pop culture references, so I'd like to start updating those at some point, maybe after I've finished the book list. I'm making an excel spreadsheet and lists on goodreads listopia by season, if you're interested you can just search gilmore girls on goodreads!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="692">Graham was the boy [[Rory]] went on a casual date with following final exams during her freshman year of Yale. ([[4.21]]) Rory's grandmother, [[Emily]] introduced the two while Rory was packing up her things after her last final. Emily had known Graham since he was baby. Graham had mentioned to Emily that he was going out with some friends that had also had a Saturday final. Graham invited Rory to come along. The group went bar-hopping, and Rory felt uncomfortable, so when they left to go to the next bar, Rory opted out and called [[Dean]] to come get her. Graham had actually appeared to like Rory quite a bit. Rory referred to Graham as a prick.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1891">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;''''There's so many extra children, '''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;'''we could just feed the children, to these tigers.''''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Hello there, my name starts with ''L'' and does not end with ''ove''.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm new to Wikia or at least new to the registered part. And I want to apologize for my grammar and spelling mistakes in advance. I fail a lot without SpellCheck. SpellCheck is the worst invention ever, it makes the user so..incompetent. D=&lt;br /&gt;Well.

I currently watch Pretty Little Liars, the Vampire Diaries, Misfits and I used to watch Gilmore Girls, Crossing Jordan, CSI:NY, Full House, Hogan’s Heroes, Stargate and some more.

I think Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings are incommensurable. And I like both, in different ways.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite HP character are Severus Snape and Bill Weasley. Can't reasonable explain why I like Bill but I don't like Snape out of pity. I liked him for hating the son of the guy he hated and for the way Rufus Beck voiced him. I mean hating someone for such a unreasonable reason is so.. human. I didn't read the last volume right off the bat so when all those Snape-lovers popped up I was like &quot;WTF is wrong with you? He killed Dumbilidore and now you love him? Get any stranger please?!&quot; I mean I do know - now - that most people simply pity him and: Okay, go ahead but please stop comparing every pitiful person to him. It's so annoying.&lt;br /&gt;My LotR favorite characters are... more than two. Merry&amp;Pippin, Sam, Gimli, Aragorn, Legolas and the Ents. I mean talking trees are like the most amazing creatures ever. Forget Pirates and sparkling Vampires get a Tree! Back to the roots, baby!




Btw, what's the fucking point in having one motheralish-thingy board to register to (wikia) then you gotta put basic stuf like a profil in every fucking wiki you start to use?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="567">I don't understand why people hate Jess so much! He is the best boyfriend Rory's ever had. He treated her right. He understood her! Dean and Logan never were good enough for her! They weren't good for her. She was perfect and happy with Jess. Logan made her so sad all the time. And Dean always pushed her to do something and always complained when she wanted to do something else. And also she never cheated on Jess but she cheated on Logan and Dean with Jess, so that just proves to show how much she loves him but won't admit it to herself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="917">I thinks nowadays as computer has become a common tool found in every home and office,and the popularity of online gaming is increasing tremendously. Friv is one of the best games found online. They have excellent collection of intellectual games for making the mind sharper and analytical skills perceptive. Children returning from school or people coming home from offices find these online games as very good form of de-stressing and rejuvenation. You can play these games with young, old, friend, family, colleague or neighbor, as they are sure to entice any age group of people.

So, you can say what you need about being older and still performing video games online, but using internet sites like friv.ind.in me seem was back to my childhood . its help games again and is my escape from the harsh reality of work!

----

Wish all you relax in comfort and fun with [http://friv.ind.in/ friv ]games online daily.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2157">[[File:Glenn.jpg|thumb|Glenn working for the Yale Daily News]] 
Glenn Babble is a student at Yale University who lives in [[Rory]]'s dorm during her freshman year and serves on the [[Yale Daily News]] writing staff.

==Important Appearances==

Glenn is seen as a very nervous, geeky, social awkward and flustered person. He is first seen in an episode of Rory and [[Paris]]' first party at Yale when he is trying to carry a keg up the stairs of the dorm and hopes someone will help him (episode 4.3 [[The Hobbit, the Sofa, and Digger Stiles]]). Other important appearances include:

- Episode [[4.10]] : Glenn is along side Rory and Paris trying to join the Yale Daily News. They have to make a newspaper hat and Glenn is very nervous and unable to make one.

- Episode [[4.17]] : Rory and Paris end up accompanying [[Janet]] and Glenn to Florida for freshman year Spring Break. While Glenn has a crush on Janet, she is only traveling with him because her friends went down without her. Paris forces Glenn to let her drive his mother's minivan because Paris feels &quot;if I'm going to die, it's going to be by my own hands.&quot; Later in the episode, Rory and Paris find him drunk and running out of the ocean with his bathing suit on in the middle of the night.

- Episode [[4.21]] : While everyone is packing up at the end of freshman year, Glenn tells Rory that he is getting back together with his girlfriend from back home. He shows Rory a picture, however she gets freaked out when it is a picture of a young girl (&quot;Glenn, this girl is like 12 years old!&quot;). Glenn responds: &quot;It's a picture of her when she was younger. Don't turn this into something dirty; she drives and everything!&quot;

- Episode 5.6 ([[Norman Mailer, I'm Pregnant!]]): When Rory gets back into being involved with school and the school newspaper, she (along with [[Doyle]]) get jealous of the fact that one of Glenn's stories from the previous year got picked up by the New York Times. It makes Rory feel guilty about spending the whole summer traveling around Europe with her grandmother instead of working on her craft.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2377">Although he only appears in four episodes, the '''Second Troubadour''' of Stars Hollow is a very recognizable character, perhaps because of his charm and humor. In addition, most of his appearances occur at monumental moments near the end of seasons. He is portrayed by Dave 'Gruber' Allen.

==Appearances==

- Episode [[1.21]] : Allen's character first appears as a troubadour who performs around town but intimidates the original troubadour, [[Grant]]. At a town meeting, Grant complains and trys to obtain a license as the only town troubadour. Although he wins, Grant and the Second Troubadour perform together on the street. We learn that he owns a Kinko's in Groton.

- Episode [[2.17]] : The Second Troubadour comes back and is intended to be the same character as the one who appeared in the first season. He is selling fruits and vegetables at a stand in the town square, which drives [[Taylor Doose]] crazy. Taylor refers to him as &quot;that long-haired freak&quot; and loses business from the produce being sold. While Taylor complains to the rest of the town at a town meeting, he finds out at the end of the episode that the Second Troubadour was only selling that which he grew in his garden himself and, after selling it all, is going to use the money to take a vacation.

- Episode [[4.21]] : At [[Liz]] and [[T.J.]]'s wedding, the Second Troubadour serves as the minister. He dresses in a Renaissance costume and sings a song comparing love to toys at the beginning of the ceremony. The song makes [[Lorelai]], [[Luke]], and [[Jess]] have to control their laughter. It is said that he was seen making out with [[Carrie Duncan]] at the wedding. Since most of those in the wedding were either friends of Liz and T.J. on the Renaissance Fair Circuit or townspeople, and the Second Troubadour does not seem to be a resident of [[Stars Hollow]], we can assume that he was also involved in performing at Renaissance fairs.

- Episode [[6.22]] : In the last episode of the sixth season, we find out that Grant was &quot;discovered&quot; by an agent and chosen to open for Neil Young. As a result, literally hundreds of troubadour performers come to Stars Hollow looking for their big break. The only visiting performer that speaks is the original Second Troubadour, when he is approached by Taylor. He informs Taylor about Grant's discovery and why all of the performers are showing up.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2298"> 
Carrie Duncan, often referred to as 'Crazy Carrie', is portrayed by Jill Brennan. Carrie was one of [[Liz Danes]]' best friends when they attended [[Stars Hollow High School]].

==Appearances==

- Episode [[4.12]]: Carrie is first mentioned when Liz first makes an appearance in [[Stars Hollow]] . When Liz tells [[Luke]] that she is staying with Carrie, Luke refers to her as 'Crazy Carrie Duncan', at which point Liz says: &quot;She's not crazy, she just likes the boys.&quot; We find out that the unseen Carrie thinks that she made out with Luke underneath the bleachers at the Homecoming Game. Luke denies it.

- Episode [[4.13]]: Carrie is mentioned again when Luke first meets [[T.J.]] Liz tells T.J. that Luke and Carrie went out, and again Luke denies it. We first see Carrie at the [[Firelight Festival]]. She approaches Luke, asking why he doesn't remember 'The Night'. She refers to him as 'Butch', which we found out was his high school nickname in the third season ([[One's Got Class and the Other One Dyes]]). In addition, Carrie and a few other women invite Luke to a Styx, REO Speedwagon, Journey concert. As a way to fend off their advances, Luke tells them: &quot;Well if it was just Styx and REO Speedwagon, I'd be there. But Journey freaks me out.&quot; We find out that all of the women are married.

- Episode [[4.21]]: Carrie serves as Liz's maid (matron?) of honor for her wedding to T.J. She, along with a few other women, get a stripper for Liz's bachelorette party, which takes place in [[Luke's Diner|Luke's Dine]] . She tries to get Luke to dance with her at the wedding, after which he tells [[Lorelai ]] that Carrie makes him very uncomfortable. Later we find out she was seen making out with several men at the wedding, including [[The Second Troubadour|the minister]], T.J.'s brother and her own husband, Barry.

- Episode [[5.15]]: Carrie serves as the director of the Stars Hollow Elementary School's production of Fiddler on the Roof. [[Lulu]] is also involved as she is the teacher of the class and [[Kirk]], while the only adult, will be playing Tevye. Luke is helping to build the sets and has to fend off passes by Carrie at rehearsals. At rehearsals, Carrie can't seem to be able to keep track of her daughter, who is in musical and seems to frequently hide from her mother.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="931">'''Archie Skinner''' is the reverend at the church in [[Stars Hollow]]'s town square. He shares the church facilities with the Rabbi David Barans and is seen conducting the funerals of [[Fran Weston]] ([[3.20]] ) and Stan ([[4.11]] ), the man who gave money to fix the church bells, and the baptism of Sookie and Jackson's children, Davy and Martha Belleville. He is first seen with the Rabbi in episode [[Take the Deviled Eggs...|3.6]] deciding whether to allow the 'Town Loner' to protest on the steps of the church, since [[Taylor]] turned him down to protest in the town square. He is also seen participating in other town events, like the discussion and reenactment of the [[Battle of Stars Hollow]] in episode [[5.11]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1236">[[File:Gilmore-girls-pulp-friction-14.jpg|thumb|Robert at Finn's Tarentino-themed party.]] 
'''Robert''' is a student at [[Yale ]] University with [[Rory]] who she meets through [[Logan Huntzberger]]. He is first seen at the [[Life and Death Brigade]] stunt that Rory is invited to cover for the newspaper in You Jump, I Jump Jack (5.7) and a few months later at a poker game that Logan hosts for his friends. While Rory and Logan are dating but not exclusive, Rory tries to make Logan jealous by accepting Robert's offer to be his date at [[Finn]]'s Quentin Tarentino-themed birthday party in the episode [[Pulp Friction]]. While we are not sure whether Robert's last name is really Grimaldi, it is what Rory tells Lorelai when Lorelai seems concerned that little is known about Robert. The confused look on Rory's face when she says it makes the viewer wonder if she made his last name up on the spot to appease her mother. We see Robert one more time while he is planning a final Life and Death Brigade stunt in Costa Rica before graduation with Logan, [[Colin]] and Finn in season six.

Gilmore Girls follows the story of Rory Gilmore and her thirty-something single mother, Lorelai Gilmore, who live in the small town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut.

The town is filled with all kinds of quirky characters, including Sookie St. James, a chef and close friend of the Gilmore girls, and Luke Danes, Lorelai's on-and-off boyfriend who owns a diner in the town centre.
