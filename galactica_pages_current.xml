'''''33''''' is the first episode of the [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 Series)]] , immediately following the events of [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|the miniseries]]. It was written by series creator [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0601822/ Ronald D. Moore], and directed by [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753382/ Michael Rymer]. '''''33''''' originally aired on [[Wikipedia:Sky One|Sky One]] in the [[Wikipedia:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] on October 18, 2004, and subsequently aired on the [[Wikipedia:Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] in the [[Wikipedia:Unites States of America|United States]] on January 14, 2005.

''33'' follows ''[[Galactica]]'' and her [[civilian fleet]] as they are forced to contend with constant [[Cylon]] pursuit for days without sleep. The episode was lauded by both cast and crew in addition to winning the 2005 [[Wikipedia:Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form|Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]].

==Episode Digest==
Having fled the besieged [[Ragnar Anchorage]] following the [[Fall of the Twelve Colonies]], the convoy of refugee starships is relentlessly pursued and attacked by Cylon [[Basestar]]. The fleet must execute a [[FTL|faster-than-light]] jump every 33 minutes to escape the Cylons, who consistently arrive at the new jump coordinates approximately 33 minutes later. After five days and 237 jumps, the fleet's crew and passengers, particularly those aboard ''Galactica'', have been operating without sleep while facing the strain of nearly constant military action. After an update of the survivor headcount (discounting 300 over-counted), the President's whiteboard total is reduced to 49,998 souls.

Meanwhile, on [[Caprica]], Lieutenant [[Karl Agathon|Karl &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon]] fails to elude Cylon patrols and is captured and taken prisoner by a [[Number Six]]. Helo is &quot;rescued&quot; from his Cylon captors by a [[Number Eight]] in the guise of his crewmate [[Sharon Valerii|Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii]].

Back at the fleet, the ''[[Olympic Carrier]]'', a commercial passenger vessel with 1,345 souls aboard, is missing and may have been left behind during the 238th consecutive jump. With the ship assumed lost to the Cylons, the attacks unexpectedly cease, allowing the fleet some respite. Three hours later however, the ''Olympic Carrier'' suddenly rejoins the fleet. [[Gaius Baltar]], convinced by his internal version of Number Six, convinces President [[Laura Roslin]] that the ship may have been infiltrated with Cylons and now poses a threat to the fleet's safety. When the ''[[Olympic Carrier]] s'' return the Cylon attacks resume 33 minutes after. ''Galactica'' also detects active nuclear weapons aboard the passenger liner, which has begun to disregard orders from Commander [[William Adama]]. President Roslin and Commander Adama order Captain [[Lee Adama|Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama]] and Lieutenant [[Kara Thrace|Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace]] to destroy it. After hesitating to fire on what is ostensibly a civilian ship, the colonial officers destroy the ship while the rest of the colonial fleet jumps away. Baltar's internal Number Six explains to him that that God is looking after his interests, implying that [[Dr. Amarak|Dr.&amp;nbsp;Amarak]] (a scientist on the ''Olympic Carrier ''That urgently tried to contact Roslin) had knowledge of Baltar's unwitting collusion with the Cylon attack on [[Twelve Colonies of Kobol|the colonies]].

After the fleet's last jump the Cylons do not return. The President's survivor whiteboard aboard ''[[Colonial One]]'' is updated with one additional soul (to 47,973) with the birth of the fleet's first child aboard the ''[[Rising Star]]''&amp;mdash;a boy.

==Behind the scenes==
===Writing===
Preparing for production of ''Battlestar Galactica''{{'s}} first season, writer and series creator [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0601822/ Ronald D. Moore] wrote a short list of potential storylines, one of which was &quot;the fleet jumps every 33 minutes; because the Cylons are relentlessly pursuing them, the crew gets no sleep.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot;&gt;DVD commentary for ''33'', Season 1 boxset.&lt;/ref&gt; Conferring with fellow executive producer David Eick, the two decided that this story would be &quot;the best way to kick off the season&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt; Moore described writing &quot;33&quot; as a great experience; he wrote the whole script without a story outline or much structure, excited to begin the first episode of the first season and start the first year already &quot;at the end of the road&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RDM blog&quot;&gt;[http://blogs.scifi.com/battlestar/archives/2005/01/why-33-minutes.php Ronald D. Moore's Sci Fi Channel blog] - ''[T]he mystery of 33 will be permanent on this show. No explanation, not even the attempt.  Let it just be a number that seemed like an eternity for five long days on the battlestar ''Galactica''.&lt;/ref&gt; Moore wrote the episode over his Christmas break before the series was officially picked up; he later claimed that this aspect was what made the episode &quot;one of the more fun projects that [he] wrote all of the first season.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt;

David Eick found the episode to be a &quot;standalone concept&quot; that didn't require having seen the miniseries to understand it. Because the miniseries ended &quot;at a very happy place&quot;, starting the series in the middle of a crisis without explanation, and showing the audience that &quot;actually, while you&amp;mdash;the audience&amp;mdash;were away, really bad things have been happening&quot; made for a much more intriguing and interesting story.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt; ''33''{{'s}} complex storyline was a harbinger for episodes to come, and laid the groundwork with the network and audiences alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt;

Moore explained on his blog that the number 33 had no hidden meaning or significance, only that he felt it sufficiently long to allow minor functions like snacking, showering, or cat napping, but was too short to allow anybody to gain any meaningful sleep and recharge their batteries. Further, Moore intentionally gave the number no meaning to avoid creating and inserting unnecessary technobabble into a drama-driven episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;RDM blog&quot; /&gt;

===Production===
''33'' was directed by [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753382/ Michael Rymer] who had previously directed the Battlestar Galactica mini-series in 2003. He accepted the job without reading the script, saying that based on his writing experience, &quot;33&quot; went well beyond his expectations and excited him.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt; [[Bear McCreary]] originally composed the musical theme &quot;Boomer Theme&quot; for this episode; it was later expanded for use with [[Sharon Agathon]], before becoming the ''de facto'' &quot;Hera Theme&quot; for the character [[Hera Agathon]] in the [[Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009 Series)|fourth season]] episode, &quot;[[Islanded in a Stream of Stars]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCreary blog&quot;&gt;[http://www.bearmccreary.com/blog/?p=1671 Bear McCreary's ''Battlestar'' blog]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Stephen McNutt|Stephen&amp;nbsp;]]McNutt was the director of photography for the miniseries, but when Eick learned he was unavailable for the series, with whom he had worked on [[Wikipedia:American Gothic (TV series)|''American Gothic'']]. In the interim, McNutt had moved on to shooting in high-definition video; this was fortuitous for the production team because, while Ransom had filmed the miniseries on 35 mm film, the production team was switching to high-definition video for the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt;

Executive producer David Eick opined that ''33'' was the &quot;silver bullet&quot; that ultimately tipped the scales in their favor and convinced the Sci Fi Channel to pick up the series. The network's biggest concern in picking up the series was that ''Battlestar Galactica'' would fall victim to the same trappings of space opera as other television properties (''Star Trek'', ''Andromeda'', ''Stargate''). Two aspects that assuaged these concerns were specifically discussed in the episode's DVD commentary. First, ''33'' went into Gaius Baltar's ([[James Callis]]) mind and visited his [[Gaius Baltar's house|house]] on Caprica (shot in Lions Bay, British Columbia);&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt; being swept away by the blue skies and beaches in his fantasy was not the sort of imagery expected of space opera-type shows. Second was going back to the devastated Caprica and following-up with Helo's ([[Tahmoh Penikett]]) story.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt;

With sleep deprivation one of the major plot points of the episode, actor [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001579/ Edward James Olmos] (William Adama) liaised with an expert on the subject and the crew to best depict the actual effects realistically. Following up, director Michael Rymer gave each main cast member a specific symptom to play up, so as to avoid repetition on screen. Olmos and several other cast members took their study a step further, to immerse themselves by restricting their sleep patterns to about three hours a night to emphasize what their expert was imparting.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsgtoc&quot;&gt;''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Official Companion]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt;

In the episode's DVD commentary, Moore and Rymer related how there were endless discussion about the clocks to feature in this episode. Concerns over digital versus analog, size and shape, the ratio of digital to analog clocks, whether they should run forwards or backwards, and whether any labels should be stenciled or hand-drawn were all brought up. David Eick also noted that as of the commentary's recording, the clock at [[Felix Gaeta]]'s ([[Alessandro Juliani]]) station still had its ''33'' label affixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt;

====Editing====
The first cut of ''33'' was ten minutes too long. Despite this, the production crew took extra care not to eliminate &quot;human moments&quot; in their efforts to trim the episode. These included a shot of [[Galen Tyrol]] ([[Aaron Douglas]]) and [[Cally Henderson Tyrol|Cally Henderson]] ([[Nicki Clyne]]) walking across ''Galactica''{{'s}} hangar bay, a shot of [[Socinus|Crewman Socinus]] ([[Alonso Oyarzun]]) giving a bedraggled look over the shoulder of another crewmember, and a shot of [[Anastasia Dualla]] ([[Kandyse McClure]]) walking through ''Galactica''{{'s}} remembrance corridor.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt;

In a question-and-answer session, Moore revealed a scene written for, but cut from, the episode. In the cut scene, the recurring prop in the characters' briefing room was to have been explicitly introduced and explained; the prop remained in the series, but its back-story was cut.&lt;ref name=&quot;RDM blog2&quot;&gt;[http://blogs.scifi.com/battlestar/2005/01/q-a-1.php Ronald D. Moore's Sci Fi Channel blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a scene cut from ''33'' where we saw Laura being given her copy of the photo along with a card that said it was taken on the roof of the capitol building on [[Aerilon]] during the attack. The photo was inspired by the famous shot of the fire-fighters raising the flag at Ground Zero that became iconic. I thought the Colonies would have their own version of this -- a snapshot taken in the moment that becomes a symbol of the day they can never forget and of all they had lost. The photo itself is of a soldier falling to his knees (possibly shot or simply overcome by emotion) as he stands on the rooftop over looking the devastation of his city, while the Colonial flag waves at the edge of frame. The inscription below the photo on Laura's plaque reads, &quot;Lest We Forget&quot; in itself a reference to the inscription on the watch presented to John Wayne's character in &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other cut scenes included one shot in the pilots' head, showing the pilots &quot;wrecked and exhausted [...] with an exchange between Starbuck and Apollo&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt; as well as several shots of Commander Adama (Olmos) gagging and vomiting because of acid reflux brought on by sleep deprivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt; Another line of Olmos'&amp;mdash;an ''ad-lib'' about suicides in the fleet&amp;mdash;was cut so as not to alienate audiences by being &quot;too dark&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt;

As originally written and shot, when Apollo ([[Jamie Bamber]]) fires on the ''Olympic Carrier'', it was made clear that he sees people inside. Moore wrote the scene to be strong and clear that the characters were making the decision to fire on the passenger liner in full awareness of the consequences to illustrate and emphasize &quot;the uncompromising nature of the show.&quot; This was an &quot;enormous fight&quot; between Moore and the network, with the latter feeling this was another scene that was &quot;too dark&quot; and had the potential to turn away audiences; the network further implied that if the scene were left intact, they may have been compelled to air the episodes out of order. To placate the network, Moore and Eick changed the ending of the episode and &quot;cheated&quot;; instead, when Apollo flies by the ''Olympic Carrier'', it is unclear whether or not there is anybody inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt;

In a &quot;small act of defiance&quot;, visual effects supervisor [[Gary Hutzel]] snuck in small, indeterminate movement behind one or two of the ''Olympic Carrier''{{'s}} windows on behalf of the production and writing teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt; The episode also originally ended with Helo's escape from the Cylons on Caprica; again tasked by the network to keep the episode from being &quot;too dark&quot;, Moore wrote in an additional scene&amp;mdash;President Roslin ([[Mary McDonnell]]) learning of the newborn&amp;mdash;upon which to end the episode on a hopeful note.&lt;ref name=&quot;33 DVD commentary&quot; /&gt;

===Release and reception===
&quot;33&quot; first aired in the United Kingdom on 18 October, 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;SkyOne&quot;&gt;[http://www.cult.tv/index.php?cm_id=606&amp;cm_type=article Sky One finds the outlandish once more in its schedules]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States on 14 January, 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;TVG&quot;&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=191395&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=4371612 TV Guide listing from TVGuide.com]&lt;/ref&gt; almost three months later. UK viewers obliged US ''Battlestar Galactica'' fans by pirating the episode&amp;mdash;uploading Torrents to the Internet&amp;mdash;within hours of its Sky One airing.&lt;ref name=&quot;eWeek&quot;&gt;[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Data-Storage/Will-Copyright-Holders-Lose-the-Pirate-Booty-556524/ Will Copyright Holders Lose the Pirate Booty?]&lt;/ref&gt;

''33'' has been released thrice on home video as part of the [[Battlestar Galactica Season 1|first season]] collected sets; on 26 July, 2005 as a Best Buy exclusive, again on 20 September, 2005, and finally as an HD DVD set on 4 December, 2007. The episode was also released on 28 July, 2009 as part of the entire series' home video set on both DVD and Blu-ray Disc.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvshowsondvd&quot;&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releaselist.cfm?ShowID=8735 TVShowsOnDVD.com - Release Information for Battlestar Galactica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both series creator Ronald D. Moore and star Jamie Bamber claim ''33'' as their favourite episode. Bamber described it as &quot;...the perfect episode of ''Battlestar Galactica''.&quot; Emphasizing the dark, gritty, and nightmarish aspects of the episode, the actor felt it was a microcosm of the series as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACEDmag&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080103041056/http://acedmagazine.com/content/view/677/1/{{cite magazine ACED Magazine Battlestar Galactica: Cast Interviews]&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2009 interview with the ''Los Angeles Times'', Moore opined that the episode was a &quot;fantastic way to open that first year.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT&quot;&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/03/battlestar-ga-4.html 'Battlestar Galactica' finale: interview with Ron Moore, Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

''33'' won the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form,&lt;ref name=&quot;hugo&quot;&gt;[http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=12 The Hugo Awards - 2005 Hugo Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; and drew a 2.6 household Nielsen rating, attracting 3.1 million viewers and making it the #2 program on cable (8pm-11pm).&lt;ref name=&quot;tfc&quot;&gt;[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20050119scifi01 Viewers Embrace SCI FI's 'Galactica', The Futon Critic]&lt;/ref&gt; as of March, 2010, members of the user-contributed television review sites the Internet Movie Database and TV.com rated ''33'' at 8.4 and 9.2 (rated &quot;Superb&quot;) out of 10 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519761/ &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; 33 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tv.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.tv.com/episode/307360/summary.html Battlestar Galactica (2003): 33 - TV.com]&lt;/ref&gt; At the website Television Without Pity, the staff review rated the episode an &quot;A+&quot;, while (as of March 2010) 450 of their readers awarded it an average grade of &quot;B&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TWOP&quot;&gt;[http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/battlestar_galactica/33.php Television Without Pity]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Post''{{'s}} &quot;10 Most Dramatic Moments of the ’00s&quot; included &quot;33&quot; in its #10 spot, describing it as the premiere episode of &quot;a sci-fi show with high stakes and serious guts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYP&quot;&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/tvblog/drama_mama_the_most_dramatic_moments_GegdJvSRQiQ3blNILZP7qI Drama Mama: The 10 Most Dramatic Moments of the ’00s, ''New York Post'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3074">Colonial One is a civilian starship that serves as the headquarters for the President of the Twelve Colonies. It is a small, FTL-capable ship that is dwarfed by the Battlestar Galactica; the ship can easily dock within one of Galactica's flight pods. Colonial One can also land on and take off from a planetary surface.[4]

Prior to the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies, Colonial One is a Caprican civilian starliner known as Colonial Heavy 798. The ship had been chartered by the Colonial government to transport then-Secretary of Education Laura Roslin and her staff to the Battlestar Galactica's decommissioning ceremony.

Following the Cylon attack, along with the elimination of most of the government, Laura Roslin becomes the President of the Twelve Colonies. The ship takes on the call sign Colonial One, and is used to coordinate the collection and organisation of the civilian refugee fleet. After leading the 50,000 survivors to rendezvous with Galactica, which survives the attack, Colonial One becomes the residence and de facto &quot;capitol&quot; of the Fleet government. Although the call sign is based on the real-world United States protocol of referring to any Air Force, Marine Corps, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, or civilian aircraft as, respectively, &quot;Air Force One&quot;, &quot;Marine One&quot;, &quot;Army One&quot;, &quot;Navy One&quot;, &quot;Coast Guard One&quot; or &quot;Executive One&quot; when the President is aboard, Colonial One retains this moniker throughout the series, irrespective of the President's presence or absence and is never again referred to as Colonial Heavy 798, apart from during a flashback to before the holocaust; likewise, neither Galactica nor any other vessel adopts the name when the President is aboard.

After the discovery and colonization of New Caprica, Colonial One is landed on the planet's surface and serves as the residence and office of Gaius Baltar, who becomes president just prior to the colonisation. As such, it is captured in the Cylon occupation. During the liberation of New Caprica and the evacuation of its human population, Colonial One is recaptured from the Cylons and leaves the planet with Laura Roslin aboard. Gaius Baltar is left behind with the Cylon occupation forces. The ship becomes the seat of legislative authority as well; with Cloud 9, destroyed by the nuclear warhead which Baltar had given to Gina Inviere, the reconstituted Quorum of Twelve hold their meetings at a conference table aboard Colonial One. Most of the Quorum are assassinated aboard the ship by Tom Zarek during his coup d'état; only those absent from the meeting, such as Lee Adama, escape.

Colonial One is ultimately destroyed after finding a new Earth. On Admiral Adama's orders, Galactica and the rest of the fleet are directed into the Sun by Anders.{{Individual_ship_infobox

The '''Luxury liner''' is a type vessel of [[Fleet|the Fleet]] with 6 surviving the attacks by the [[cylons]]. One ship designated Gemenon liner 1701 never made it into the fleet and was left daralect because the fleet did not have enough resources to repair the damage.[[File:Gemenon-liner-01.jpg|thumb|This is one of the vessels.]][[File:Gemenon-liner-02.jpg|thumb|The Pan Galactic vessel.

Celestra is a deep space exploration vessel filled with scientific laboratories, research equipment and advanced sensor systems. It also features a long-range FTL drive for distant travel and designed to function for years without resupply of fuel reserves and life support.

Celestra appeared several times in fleet shots throughout the series but was not given a central storyline.

The Celestra seems to be a carry-over design similar in appearance to the &quot;[[Electronics Ship]]&quot; seen in the original series

}} The Space Park is really a ship called the Zephyr, which is an older ship. It uses the disk around the middle of the hull to simulate Artificial Gravity, since an Artificial Gravity Generator was too expensive at the time to put on a ship of that size. Over the years, it has had several modifications done to make it worthy to remain in the Fleet.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:colonialraptor3.jpg|thumb|300px|Cockpit view with pilot and ECO]] --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The '''Raptor''' is a multipurpose military spacecraft featured in the re-imagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. According to producer [[Ronald D. Moore]], the Raptor is analogous to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]'s [[EA-6B Prowler]]{{Ref|aprilblog}}.

==Description==&lt;br /&gt;The Raptor's primary function with the Colonial Defense Force is as an electronic warfare platform. It scouts ahead of the fleet, accompanies [[Colonial Viper|Vipers]] and provides targeting information and electronic counter measures (akin to the Prowler). Raptors can also carry external munitions to assist Vipers against large targets. Its non-combat roles include SAR ([[search and rescue]]) operations (akin to the [[SH-60 Seahawk]]) and transport of military personnel in hostile areas. Raptors, like Vipers are capable of atmospheric operations but unlike Vipers are also capable of short-range [[FTL (Battlestar Galactica)|FTL]] jumps. Standard crew includes a pilot and [[Electronic countermeasures|electronics countermeasure]] officer (ECM)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mini Series, Part 2&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)| title=Mini Series, Part 2| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|Battlestar Galactica: The Miniseries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is designed for reconnaissance, scout operations, electronic countermeasures supporting Vipers, marine assaults, ambulance, EVAC, and general transport.

It has a multitude of electronic countermeasure and monitoring tools including jamming transmissions, scrambling signals of guided weapons, and Viper [[Identification friend or foe]] operations&lt;ref name=&quot;Mini Series, Part 2&quot; /&gt;.

As a scout it can operate independently or with other Raptors and Vipers using short and medium-range scans to detect radio, heat, or other signatures from spacecraft, scanning planet surfaces for life, energy output, and mineral content and location, scouting ahead and looking for hazards before its [[Battlestar (fictional spaceship)|Battlestar]] takes an FTL jump, and search and rescue operations.

A Raptor can carry about eight to ten adults in addition to its two-person crew functioning as a transporter and can carry about eight marines including their equipment as an assault vessel. The crew of a Raptor operate using their flight suits and helmets in order to ensure their protection in case of any hull breach causing depressurization of its cabin.

It cannot takeoff from a Battlestar's launch tube like the Vipers because of its large size; it is launched from a flight pod instead. Battlestars carry squadrons of 8 to 10 Raptors and each Raptor is designated to a Viper squadron with two Raptors on reserve.

The Raptors can fly in both atmosphere and space, but in order to maintain lift in an atmosphere its engines must be constantly running which consumes more fuel. At low speeds, Raptors may experience poor handling.

==Technical specifications==&lt;br /&gt;===Dimensions===&lt;br /&gt;*Length: 8.53m&lt;br /&gt;*Wingspan: 5.5m&lt;br /&gt;*Height: 2.90m

===Propulsion===&lt;br /&gt;*2x sublight engines&lt;br /&gt;*1x small-scale FTL system&lt;br /&gt;*RCS points

===Armaments===&lt;br /&gt;*Missiles similar to Vipers&lt;br /&gt;*Decoy drones, communication drones, and flares&lt;br /&gt;*Reduced electronic signature to avoid detection&lt;br /&gt;*Additional hard point attachments for external missile racks and rocket pods

}}The Olympic Carrier was a luxury liner in the Colonial fleet on the run from the [[Cylons]]. The Carrier was following the fleet in several [[FTL]] jumps but was lost on the 238th jump. The fleet had no idea that the Carrier was missing until the ships began to report in. The [[Galactica]] figured out that the ship was missing when it didn't show up on radar. The other ships just moved on including Galactica. Then later out of the blue the Olympic carrier showed up on a course to rejoin the fleet. The Galactica sent 2 [[Viper]] fighters and a [[Raptor]] to intercept the ship. The 3 fighters contacted the Carrier and the captain said to the three fighters &quot;We got lost and we used the three hours we had to repair the malfunctioning FTL drive.&quot; and the fighters terminated the communications with the Carrier and then the Galactica's crew detected the presence of a nuclear warhead on board the ship and orderd the fighters to keep communications offline with the ship and instead flashed the message &quot;Stop your engines and stay away from the fleet&quot; but the ship still had the engines at full. The fighters sent a message to the ship [[Colonial One]] and the president on board told the fighters to destroy the Carrier if it posed any threat to the fleet. The fighters continued to send messages to the ship to stop it's engines but got no response.With the ship looming closer to the fleet, one Viper fighter codename &quot;Apollo&quot; went along the starboard side and then approached the ship's stern and aimed the fighter's guns directly at the Carrier's engines and hesitating opened fire. The Olympic Carrier shudered fom the impact and exploded in a chain reaction. With nothing left from the explosion or debris. That ended the Olympic Carrier.

Hi. Is this wiki still alive? Looks like there haven't been many (any?) edits since Feb '06. With the rapid growth in popularity of the reimaged show, I'm sure there'd be some willing contributors, if this wiki got a bit more attention. --[[User:Careax|Careax]] 01:25, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

:I think the wiki just needs some more [[Wikia:promotion|promotion]]. Are there any battlestar forums where you could suggest new users come and edit here? [[w:User:Angela|Angela]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Angela|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;

::Hi Angela. A post on the [http://forums.scifi.com/index.php?s=5fce9cb66b1744150dd45500e8d9c64b&amp;showforum=24 SciFi Channel web forum] would be a great starting point. A link on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica Wikipedia BSG page] would also be a good place to list it. Some news groups like ''rec.arts.sf'' might also be worthwhile.
::There's another BSG wiki already out there (not hosted by Wikia), but every time I've tried to access it it's been down or horribly slow. So I totally agree with you: this wiki probably does just need more promotion. --[[User:Careax|Careax]] 07:06, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

== Wiki organization, and home page ==

I've added a table to the home page, separating topics from classic BSG from the re-imagined BSG. As the novels are set around the classic BSG, I think they should be placed in that section, rather than having their own.

Also, is there a way of breaking up the content into 2 distinct groups. Personally, I'd have broken classic BSG and re-imagined BSG into separate wikis. But I can appreciate the reasons why that didn't happen. But if content for both is going to share a wiki, it would be nice if a line in the sand could be drawn between them, as I really think there's going to be no cross-references. I suspect almost all fans will want to focus on the ''Re-imagined BSG'' section and totally ignore the ''Classic BSG'' section, or vice versa. Maybe use different portals, or something similar? Cheers, --[[User:Careax|Careax]] 07:31, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
: Redundant with [http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki Battlestar Wiki]. -- [[User:74.225.103.50|74.225.103.50]] 18:58, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
::It isn't. This one is under a [http://freedomdefined.org/Definition free] license so can be used by anyone for any purpose. Please see [[w:Why use Wikia|Why use Wikia]] for many other reasons. [[w:User:Angela|Angela]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Angela|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:03, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
:::Battlestar Wiki uses the exact same license as Memory-Alpha, the Trekkie wiki, and uses the same software as Wikia. Any other reasons? -- [[User:74.225.103.50|74.225.103.50]] 02:47, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
::::Wikia is using a modified version of MediaWiki, which as we continue to develop the software will get better and better. For example, [[w:Help:YouTube|YouTube]] can be integrated with the content, users can be [[w:Help:Enotif|notified]] of changes via email, [[w:Help:Calendar|calendars]] can be used on pages, dynamic pages lists, parser functions, and [[Special:Version|much more]] We also have excellent spam control and cross-wiki vandal blocking, which leaves users more time to focus on the content instead of dealing with bad edits. Have a look at [http://armchairgm.com/ ArmchairGM] or our new [http://entertainment.wikia.com/ entertainment wiki] to see some of the other new features we are working on, including automatic listings of good content, and public voting and commenting, [http://armchairgm.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Create_Opinion Wysiwyg editing], and [http://armchairgm.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Special:ChallengeView&amp;id=141 user challenges]. [[w:User:Angela|Angela]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Angela|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:32, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
::::Odd, because Battlestar Wiki also has had very little instances of spamming, has a calendar feature, and members of the wiki have developed an extension [http://blog.battlestarwiki.org/2007/02/15/video-feature-to-be-implemented/ that embed video]. Add to that, they already have a large community of contributors, so, again, why the redundancy? -- [[User:74.225.103.50|74.225.103.50]] 14:58, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::Why are you worried about it? If you don't want the redundancy, you're welcome to bring the other wiki over here. :) If not, Wikia are still going to host a wiki on every topic with potential to form a large community, which of course includes content on Battlestar Galactica. The advantage of freely licensed content is that nothing is lost by doing this since other wikis can share the content rather than competing. [[w:User:Angela|Angela]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Angela|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

::::::Actually this is beter scince with this wiki people who have accounts on other wikias can just come here and use there account here and not have to make a new one. Also, for the sake of making this diffrent sligtly so people will come here and it wont make it entirly redundent is do it like Memory Beta is to Memory alpha, Memory alpha is a non wikia wiki wile Memory beta is. Memory beta however has section for both Cannon and Fannon wile memory alpha (which does have better cannon info) is just cannon. (at least i think thats what it is, im not sure, i could be confused(well either way im confused:).)) So I propose this site make a Fannon section. [[User:Fell Skyhawk]] [[User:Fell Skyhawk|,]] 22:52, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::::Memory Alpha is non-canon as opposed to fanon, which means they report on Star Trek stuff that isn't canon (like non-official but published books). The Fanon wikis are where the users are writing their own original content in the setting of Star Trek or whatever (it's actually a little misnamed and ought to be fan fiction, not fanon). Anyway, I suggest this wiki can cover both canon and non-canon, but not fan fiction, which could be added to a new wiki like battlestarfanon.wikia if anyone wanted to [[w:c:requests|start that wiki]]. By the way, Wikia does host Memory Alpha as well, although due to its license and history it is kept on a separate URL.

== All those deletion tags ==

Do all those deletion tags need to be on the main page? They're not actually accessible through simply editing, but are probably locked up in some templates somewhere.

== Pages ripped off from battlestarwiki.org ==

Hi, You may know about the existence of battlestarwiki.org. Apparently the licensing used there is CC BY-NC-SA which is not the not compatible with the one used by Wikia. I have found that some of the pages here are a direct rip off, and a few other pages have large sections copied over. I request anyone, to remove or edit the content so that it stays acceptable as per Creative Commons. I have provided a list of pages which are in violation. Other pages also might be in violation.

=== These pages are a complete copy ===
* [[New Caprica]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/New_Caprica
* [[Pegasus]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Pegasus_(RDM)
* [[Viper_Mark_VII]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Viper_Mark_VII
* [[Viper_Mark_II]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Viper_Mark_II
* http://galactica.wikia.com/index.php?title=New_Caprica&amp;oldid=3941 from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/New_Caprica
* http://galactica.wikia.com/index.php?title=Pegasus&amp;oldid=4253 from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Pegasus_(RDM)
* [[Daybreak,_Part_I]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Daybreak,_Part_I
* http://galactica.wikia.com/index.php?title=Daybreak,_Part_I&amp;oldid=3605 from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Daybreak,_Part_I

=== These pages have large sections copied over ===
* http://galacticafanon.wikia.com/wiki/Humanoid_Cylon
* [[Humanoid Cylon]]
* [[Mythology]]
* [[Battle of New Caprica]]

=== These pages have been copied over from wikipedia ===

Now, Its perfectly alright to copy articles from wikipedia as they use the same licensing. But that does not mean Attribution need not be given. I find no sort of attribution given to the authors on Wikipedia. This is a violation off CC BY-SA.

== Twelve colonies info ==

Hello I was wondering if someone could tell me where the info on the different colonies was sourced from. I ask because some of the information is either different or not mentioned on the battlestar wiki. Did they come from any past statments made by thw writers?
:A large amount of the information on this wiki is fanon and not reliable. [[Special:Contributions/78.150.23.8|78.150.23.8]] 08:04, December 15, 2013 (UTC)</text>

{{Série télévisée en production}}
[[Image:Battlestar Galactica.jpg|200px|right|thumb]]
{{Liste séries TV}}
'''''Battlestar Galactica''''' est une [[série télévisée]] [[États-Unis d'Amérique|américaine]] de [[science-fiction]], créée par [[Ronald D. Moore]], dont la diffusion américaine a débuté sur [[Sci Fi Channel]] les [[8 décembre|8]] et [[9 décembre]] [[2003]]. Cette nouvelle série, communément appelée '''''Galactica 2003''''' ou '''''Battlestar Galactica 2003''''' ('''''BSG 2003''''' pour les initiés), s'inspire de l'ancienne série ''[[Galactica]]'' créée en [[1978]] par [[Glen A. Larson]] (parfois renommée depuis ''Battlestar Galactica 1978'' ou ''BSG 1978''). 

En [[France]], les deux épisodes de la [[Télésuite|minisérie]] (formant l'épisode pilote) ont été respectivement diffusés en [[VF]] le [[19 janvier]] [[2005]] sur [[13ème rue]], le [[30 décembre]] [[2005]] sur [[Métropole Télévision|M6]], les [[11 février|11]] et [[12 février]] [[2006]] sur [[Ztélé]] et les [[4 mai|4]] et [[11 mai]] [[2006]] sur [[Série Club]]. La première saison a été diffusée à partir du [[18 octobre]] [[2004]] sur [[Sci Fi (chaîne de télévision)|Sci Fi]] et la deuxième saison est diffusée depuis le [[2 décembre]] [[2005]] sur Sci Fi. Au [[Québec]], la série est diffusée sur [[Z télé]]. En [[Belgique]] francophone, elle est diffusée depuis le [[19 janvier]] [[2007]] sur [[La Deux]].


== Synopsis ==
Les [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]], robots humanoïdes ennemis jurés des Humains, ont complètement disparu de l'univers connu depuis la signature d'une trève il y a une quarantaine d'années. Grâce à ce répit, les Humains ont reconstruit leurs mondes (les [[douze Colonies de Kobol]]), créant de nouveaux vaisseaux et vivant désormais dans une certaine insouciance du passé. Le vieux cuirassé ''[[BSG-75 Galactica|Battlestar Galactica]]'' qui a rendu de fiers services lors de la première guerre contre les Cylons est sur le point d'être démilitarisé et transformé en musée.

C'est le moment que choisissent les Cylons pour réapparaître, plus dangereux que jamais, et dotés de nouvelles technologies qui leur permettent de ravager à nouveaux les douze colonies humaines. Protégé des moyens de brouillage ennemis par son obsolescence, seul l'antique ''Battlestar Galactica'' parvient à survivre à l'attaque et devient ainsi l'unique escorte militaire d'une flotte hétéroclite regroupant les derniers survivants de l'humanité. Afin de se donner un nouvel espoir, la flotte de réfugiés part alors en quête d'une hypothétique treizième colonie qui porterait le nom de [[Terre]] tandis que, acharnés à les exterminer, les Cylons se lancent à leur poursuite.

== Personnages principaux ==
*'''[[William Adama|William « Husker » Adama]]''' : fils de Joseph et Evelyn Adama. Il aura deux enfants avec son ex-épouse Caroline Adama, Lee et Zak Adama. Homme audacieux, sérieux et imposant par son charisme, il est le Commandant du ''Battlestar Galactica''.  Il sait aussi avoir de l'humour et a pris sous son aile le Lieutenant Kara « Starbuck » Thrace. Suite à quelques petit problèmes de voisinage avec le ''BSG-62 Battlestar Pegasus'' de l'Amiral [[Helena Cain]], il est nommé amiral par la présidente Laura Roslin.

*'''[[Laura Roslin]]''' : Ex-Secrétaire à l'Éducation, devenue le Président des Douze Colonies de Kobol, c'est une femme cultivée, généreuse et sensible. Elle a un [[cancer]] du [[sein]], dépisté le matin de l'attaque des Cylons.

*'''[[Kara Thrace|Kara « Starbuck » Thrace]]''' : le meilleur pilote de la flotte Coloniale. Casse-cou, garçon manqué, culottée et fêtarde, elle a eu une relation avec Zak Adama (elle s'apprêtait à l'épouser au temps où elle était instructeur de vol). Depuis, elle opère sur le ''BSG-75 Galactica'' en tant que pilote de ''Viper'' et lieutenant.

*'''[[Lee Adama|Lee « Apollo » Adama]]''' : fils de William et Caroline Adama et petit-fils de Joseph et Evelyn Adama. C'est un pilote très doué dans la conduite de ''Vipers''. Il retrouve son père à bord du ''BSG-75 Galactica'' quelques années après la mort de son frère, Zak. Il a entre-temps été promu capitaine. Il deviendra par la suite le conseiller militaire du Président (Laura Roslin). Il sera promu capitaine à bord ''BattleStar Pegasus'', sous les ordres de l'Amiral Cain. Promu Major, il est muté un mois plus tard à bord du ''Pegasus'', et devient à cette occasion, le second du ''Battlestar''. À la mort du commandant du ''Pegasus'', l'Amiral William Adama, son père, lui confie le poste de Commandant. Il entretient une relation avec Dualla.

*'''[[Gaïus Baltar]]''' : génie en informatique, il a élaboré le système de défense des douze colonies. Il sera utilisé par sa compagne, une ravissante Cylon nommée Numéro Six, pour mener les Humains à leur perte. Il sera élu Vice-Président au détriment de Tom Zarek.

*'''[[Numéro Huit|Sharon « Boomer » Valerii]]''' : (Cylon humanoïde modèle n°8) travaille à bord du ''BSG-75 Galactica'', c'est une pilote de ''Raptor'' très émotive et stressée. Cependant, elle n'est autre qu'un Cylon humanoïde infiltré au sein des rescapés de la flotte.

*'''[[Numéro Six]]''' : Cylon humanoïde, la sixième de la lignée. D'apparence douce, sexy et femme fatale, elle est très arrogante. Amoureuse du Docteur Gaius Baltar, Six n'hésite pas à lui dicter sa conduite dans certaines situations (elle n'est visible que par lui...).

== Personnages secondaires ==

*'''[[Galen Tyrol]]''' : chef CPO sur le ''Battlestar'', il supervise la maintenance des ''Vipers'' et des ''Raptors''. Son équipe forme le « Deck Crew 5 ». Il est aimé par tout l'équipage du pont et ils font tout pour le protéger, notamment lors de l'épisode de son aventure amoureuse avec le Lieutenant Valerii. Il a un caractère tenace et ses aptitudes au commandement font de lui un des hommes les plus résistants et le mieux préparés au combat. 

*'''[[Saul Tigh]]''' : fils d'un pilote émérite mort au combat et petit-fils d'un conseiller d'un ancien président des Douze Colonies. Le Colonel Tigh est le XO (second) du ''Galactica'' et le bras droit du Commandant Adama. Cette position lui donne de nombreuses responsabilités qui l'obligent  parfois à prendre des décisions très controversées et ses exigences sont parfois très périlleuses. Orgueilleux, autoritaire et borné, il reste néanmoins un officier fidèle et loyal, très attaché au Commandant Adama qui le soutient dans ses actions en tant qu'ami et camarade malgré sa forte dépendance à l'alcool.

*'''[[Karl Agathon|Karl C. « Helo » Agathon]]''' : ECO du lieutenant Sharon Valerii. Il tente de retourner vers la flotte après avoir cédé sa place au Docteur Gaius Baltar sur Caprica. Après son retour et l'installation des colons sur New Caprica, il sera promu XO du ''Galactica''

*'''[[Anastasia Dualla|Anastasia « Dee » Dualla]]''' : Dualla est en poste au C.I.C et est chargée des communications entre le ''Galactica'' et les autres appareils de la flotte. Elle s'occupe également du Dradis (radar) et travaille en étroite collaboration avec le Lieutenant Gaeta. Elle commencera un flirt avec Billy Keikeya, le conseiller de la Présidente Roslin. Au cours de la deuxième saison, une aventure commencera entre elle et Lee Adama, relation qui, indirectement, provoquera la mort de Billy. 

*'''[[Billy Keikeya]]''' : assistant de la Présidente, il assume de plus grandes responsabilités. Ces responsabilités ne l'ont pas empêché pas de commencer à flirter avec Dualla. Il devient le conseiller de Roslin : il a avec elle une relation privilégiée qui va au-delà de celle qui existe normalement entre une Présidente et ses adjoints. Il décédera lors de la deuxième saison au cours d'une prise d'otages.

*'''[[Tom Zarek]]''' : originaire de la planète Sagittaron, cet indépendantiste a purgé de nombreuses années de prison pour son passé de [[terrorisme|terroriste]]. Maintenant délégué de sa planète au [[Quorum des Douze]], il entretient une relation ambiguë avec la Présidente Roslin, s'opposant infatigablement à sa politique, tout en la soutenant lors de ses conflits avec les militaires.

*'''[[Brendan Constanza|Brendan « Hot Dog » Constanza]]''' : il devient un cadet pilote de ''Viper'' à la mort de plusieurs officiers sur le pont du CPO ''Galen Tyrol'' (un [[drone]] s'est détaché et a explosé). Véritable tête brûlée et inexpérimenté au départ, il saura gagner assez d'expérience pour participer a des missions importantes.

==Commentaires==
Cette nouvelle série est une modernisation de la série originelle ''[[Galactica]]'' de [[1978]] (souvent dénommée depuis ''Battlestar Galactica 1978'' ou ''BSG 1978'').

Le concept, original, est de faire une suite/remake. Une ''suite'' car la série prend en compte certains événements de la première série, et ''remake'' car les événements sont très proches, et certains personnages reprennent les noms des héros originaux.  

La note d'intention précise que les auteurs veulent garder l'idée originelle, à savoir un convoi en détresse à la recherche de la [[Terre]], au contraire de la série de 1978 qui avait bien vite adopté le &quot;format chevaleresque&quot; du groupe de héros qui aide tous ceux qu'il rencontre sur sa route...

===Style===
La nouvelle série se démarque également de l'originale sur plusieurs points.

Son créateur et producteur exécutif, [[Ronald D. Moore]], talentueux producteur et scénariste de nombreux épisodes de ''[[Star Trek : La nouvelle génération]]'' et ''[[Star Trek : Deep Space Nine]]'' ainsi que de ''[[Roswell]]'', a voulu pour ''Battlestar Galactica 2003'' une approche très ''réaliste'', lui conférant ainsi une crédibilité encore inédite en science-fiction.

La nouvelle série a transformé plusieurs protagonistes : certains hommes-clés sont désormais des femmes. Elle a également introduit l'idée que les Cylons, les [[androïde]]s ennemis des humains, ont été créés par l'Homme. En plus des soldats Cylons ''classiques'' mais ''relookés'', apparaissent des modèles humanoïdes, semblables en tous points aux humains. L'utilisation d'images de synthèse de conception récente contribuent au réalisme de la série. Enfin, un reproche souvent fait aux [[space opera]]s a été corrigé : les combats dans l'espace se font dans un quasi-silence.

Bien que les fans puristes de la série originale n'aient pas toujours apprécié ces changements, la mini série a été le plus gros succès du câble américain en 2003. Elle a même aidé à la création de Sci Fi Channel qui a connu le plus gros succès dans l'histoire de la chaîne. Ceci a permis de créer une série qui en est désormais à sa troisième saison.

Les critiques sont assez unanimes pour remarquer que cette nouvelle série est nettement supérieure à son modèle, le magazine ''Time'' allant même jusqu'à déclarer fin 2005 qu'il s'agit de la meilleure série télévisuelle de l'année.

S'inscrivant dans la grande tradition des éminentes œuvres de science-fiction que sont ''[[Star Trek]]'' et ''[[Babylon 5]]'', les scénaristes de ''Battlestar Galactica 2003'' n'hésitent jamais à traiter de problèmes sociaux, politiques, moraux, philosophiques et éthiques (contemporains ou pas) avec l'audace et la liberté que permet la science-fiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3767">[[Image:Centurion_profile_(front)_II.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Cylons from the re-imagined series of 2004.]]
The '''Cylons''' are a cybernetic civilization at war with the Twelve Colonies of humanity in the ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' [[science fiction]] franchise, in the original [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|1978]] &amp; [[Galactica 1980|1980]] series, as well as the 2003 [[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|reimagining]]. In the 1978 series, the Cylons are also the race who created the robot Cylons.

The nature and origins of Cylons differ greatly between the two ''Galactica''s. However both series feature Cylon Raiders, Cylon Basestars and [[Cylon Centurions]].

== Original continuity ==
The Cylons of the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|1978]]/[[Galactica 1980|1980]] series are not the mechanical foils seen throughout the series, but an advanced reptilian race who created the robots (who were referred to as Cylons within the show) to serve them, maintain their vast empire and to man their military forces in the face of a sudden population drop that eventually led to the Cylons' extinction - seemingly overnight. This fact is briefly mentioned in the 1978 movie-length premier of the series (near the end of episode 2 in syndication) when Apollo relates the Cylons' origin to Boxey. In the episode &quot;War of the Gods&quot;, during [[Count Iblis]]'s private discourse with Count [[Baltar]], Baltar mentions that he recognizes Iblis's voice, referring to [[Patrick McNee]]'s voicing of the [[Imperious Leader]] in the opening episode/theatrical movie (McNee also played Iblis), with Iblis countering that if that was true it must have been &quot;transcribed&quot; over a thousand yahren (years) ago and programmed into the mechanical body of the Imperious Leader.

The follow-up series ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' had a two-episode arc entitled “The Night the Cylons Landed” that featured a humanoid Cylon, though unlike its successors in the post-millennial reimagining, it was not organic, but a complex mechanical construct.

== Reimagined continuity ==
The '''Cylons''' of the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|2003 miniseries]] and current [[Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009 Series)|''Battlestar Galactica'']] series are fundamentally different from the Cylons of the [[Battlestar Galactica: The Classic Series Episodes|original 1978/1980 series]]. In the new version, the Cylons were created by humans as robotic workers and soldiers. In the original series the Cylons almost destroy the entire [[human]] civilization, chasing a few ship-borne survivors into deep space. Unlike the original series, however, the reimagined series includes twelve Cylon models who are nearly indistinguishable from human beings. Although these human-form Cylons are the focus of the series, alongside the humanoid models there are also Centurions similar to those in the original series. Much of the Cylons' technology is based heavily on bioengineering and/or synthetic biology rather than conventional robotics. Humans often derisively refer to Cylons as &quot;toasters&quot;, due to the resemblance of Cylon centurions to &quot;walking chrome toasters&quot;, as described by [[Gaius Baltar]] in the miniseries.

In contrast to the largely unexplained reason for the original Cylons' genocidal mission, religion is the primary motivation of the Cylon race in the re-imagined series. They consider humans to be sinful and flawed creations of God that therefore do not &quot;deserve&quot; to survive. The Cylons' monotheistic faith and their descriptions of God indicate a strong similarity to the Abrahamic religions.

'''William Adama''' is the commanding officer of the [[Battlestar Galactica (RDM)]].  He is predominantly the military commander throughout the re-imagined series.

==Biography==
===Early life===
In the ''[[Wikipedia:Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'' spinoff series, '''William &quot;Bill&quot; Adama''' was born on [[Caprica]], the son of [[Joseph Adama]] (a [[Wikipedia:Civil liberty|civil liberties]] [[Wikipedia:Lawyer|lawyer]] and previously a lawyer for the Ha'la'tha, the Tauron [[Wikipedia:Resistance movement|resistance movement]] turned [[Wikipedia:Organized crime|mob]]) and [[Evelyn Adama]] (an accountant) in honor of William's deceased older half-brother William &quot;Willie&quot; Adama in accord with Tauron tradition. The older William was nicknamed &quot;Willie&quot; whereas the younger William is nicknamed &quot;Bill&quot;. Both were named after their grandfather, who along with their grandmother Isabelle was killed during the Tauron Uprising. Bill was the only child of Joseph and Evelyn yet was Joseph's third child because he was born (at least) a year after YR42 on the Colonial calendar, the year when Joseph's first wife (Shannon Adama), their daughter (Tamara) and their son (Willie) were all killed. Shannon Adama's mother Ruth was also part of the Adama family during Bill's childhood, though not related to him by blood.

===Cylon War===
During the later stages of the first [[Wikipedia:Cylon (2003)|Cylon]] War,&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Valley_of_Darkness_.28D.29_2-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Valley of Darkness .28D.29-2|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Adama was a gifted pilot in the [[Colonial Fleet]]. On account of his gravelly voice, his [[Wikipedia:Aviator call sign|aviator call sign]] was &quot;Husker&quot;.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Miniseries_3-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Miniseries-3|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; When assigned to the ''Galactica'', he became involved with a Raptor pilot named Jaycie McGavin.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-4&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-4|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Arriving on the hangar deck for his first [[Viper Mark II|Viper]] combat mission, he found McGavin had been mortally wounded in combat due to her Raptor's control console exploding.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-5&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-5|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It was during this mission that he scored his first kills and for which he received a commendation.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Hero_6-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Hero-6|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Adama was aboard the [[Galactica|Battlestar ''Galactica'']] during the last week of the war when a Cylon boarding party attempted to kill the crew by depressurizing the ship. Adama later recalled that &quot;two thousand men bought the farm.&quot;&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Valley_of_Darkness_.28D.29_2-1&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Valley of Darkness .28D.29-2|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

During a battle that took place on the last day of the First Cylon War, Adama became enraged by the destruction of the Battlestar ''Columbia'' and pursued two Cylon raiders into a planetary atmosphere.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-7&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-7|[8]]]&lt;/sup&gt; His Viper was damaged in a collision and he was forced to eject; he engaged a Cylon centurion in a mid-air gunbattle while free-falling.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-8&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-8|[9]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Upon landing, he discovered what appeared to be a Cylon lab that was experimenting on human subjects.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-9&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-9|[10]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Unable to rescue the humans still held captive in the lab, Adama watched helplessly as the Cylons evacuated the base. When he called ''Galactica'' for rescue, Adama found out that the war had ended with the signing of an armistice. With the end of hostilities, the Cylons carried away whatever they were developing, unopposed.

===Merchant Marine service===
After the war ended, Adama married his first wife [[Carolanne Adama]] and fathered two sons with her: [[Zak Adama|Zak]] and [[Leland Adama|Lee]].&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Act_of_Contrition_10-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite_note-Act_of_Contrition-10|[11]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Adama later relates to Captain [[Louanne Katraine|Louanne &quot;Kat&quot; Katraine]] how, during both her pregnancies, Carolanne was convinced that she was carrying a daughter, and was surprised by the arrival of a son. Adama himself would have liked a daughter, saying that &quot;three's a good round number&quot;.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-The_Passage_11-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-The Passage-11|[12]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Adama's military career declined after the war. Like many servicemen after the end of a conflict, he was discharged. He found himself serving on a commercial [[Wikipedia:Cargo ship|freighter]] on the Caprica-Tauron run, where he met a fellow former Viper pilot, [[Saul Tigh]].&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Valley_of_Darkness_12-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Valley of Darkness-12|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; The pair forged a lasting friendship, and Adama arguably saved Tigh from his most self-destructive impulses.

===Return to the Fleet===
During this period, Adama used his wife's family's connections in the Defense Council to get himself reinstated in the Colonial Fleet with a rank of Captain. Once he had been promoted to the rank of [[Wikipedia:Major|Major]], he secured Tigh's reinstatement in the Fleet as well.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Valley_of_Darkness_12-1&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Valley of Darkness-12|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He later divorced Carolanne, and she later was engaged to marry again at the time of the Cylons' devastation of the Twelve Colonies.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Miniseries_3-1&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Miniseries-3|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

As a Major, Adama served on the Battlestar ''Atlantia'',&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Hero_6-1&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Hero-6|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; where he had an ongoing feud with the ship's [[Wikipedia:Landing signal officer|landing signal officer]] that inspired a celebration of his thousandth landing.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Act_of_Contrition_10-1&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Act of Contrition-10|[11]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He later served as the [[Wikipedia:Executive officer|executive officer]] of the Battlestar ''Columbia'', presumably as a [[Wikipedia:Colonel|Colonel]], before earning his own command, the [[Valkyrie|Battlestar ''Valkyrie'']]. Adama brought his old friend, Saul Tigh, with him as his XO.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Hero_6-2&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Hero-6|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; At some point during this phase of his career, Adama either served aboard or visited a ''Mercury'' class [[battlestar]].&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Pegasus_.28Extended.29_13-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Pegasus .28Extended.29-13|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Approximately three years before [[the Destruction of the Twelve Colonies]], the Colonial Admiralty ordered then-Commander Adama and the ''Valkyrie'' to test the Cylons' military disposition with a covert (and illegal) surveillance mission across the Armistice Line. The [[Stealthstar]] reconnaissance craft was discovered by the Cylons and damaged; Adama ordered the ''Valkyrie''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s weapons batteries to shoot it down to prevent its capture. These events precipitated his transfer to the aging Battlestar ''Galactica'' as a graceful swan-song to his career before returning to haunt him three years later.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Hero_6-3&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Hero-6|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Both William Adama's sons chose to follow in their father's footsteps and become Viper pilots. While Lee went on to become an accomplished pilot, Zak was not a natural in the cockpit. While in training, Zak began a secret relationship with [[Kara Thrace|Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace]], his flight instructor. Zak would have failed basic flight training had Kara not passed him based on her feelings for him (he had recently proposed to her). During an operational flight, Zak's Viper crashed and he was killed. This tragedy drove a wedge between Adama and his surviving son, Lee, who blamed his father for pushing Zak into military service. It was also during this time that William Adama met Kara, sparking a father-daughter relationship.

===The Cylons return===
Two years after Zak's death, the fifty-year-old ''Galactica'' was nearing the end of its service, destined to be converted into a [[Wikipedia:Museum ship|museum ship]]. On the morning following the ship's decommissioning ceremony (Caprica City Time), the Cylons launched a surprise attack on the [[Twelve Colonies]], bombarding the colonies with [[Wikipedia:Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] and destroying the majority of the Colonial Fleet. The Fleet was unable to mount an effective counterattack due to Cylon infiltration of the Colonial ships' Command Navigation Program (CNP).&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Miniseries_3-2&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Miniseries-3|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Since Adama fought in the first Cylon War, he knew that the Cylons could use electronics as part of their offensive repertoire. Adama's past experiences with the Cylons left him with a healthy distrust of sophisticated computer systems and heavy automation. He therefore decreed that as part of ''Galactica's'' [[Wikipedia:General order|standing orders]], her computer systems were never to be networked, and even though ''Galactica'' had Baltar's CNP program installed on its systems, thanks to Adama's orders it was never loaded into primary memory. As a result, the outmoded, aging ''Galactica'' was spared from Cylon infiltration attempts that crippled and subsequently destroyed much of the Colonial Fleet. However, most of ''Galactica''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Viper Mark VII]] fighters did possess the CNP and were lost early in the attack. Fortunately, as part of its museum display, the ''Galactica'' had forty older Mk II Vipers on board, including Adama's personal fighter from the First Cylon War. The CNP was later purged from ''Galactica''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s systems as well as the remainder of the Mark VII fighters.

Following the devastating attack on the Colonies, Commander Adama felt that the best course of action was a counterattack, to avenge the deaths of billions, and stand and fight for whatever was left of their civilization. He sent a message into deep space, calling for all remaining Colonial ships to regroup at Ragnar Anchorage, an unmanned munitions depot hidden in the upper atmosphere of the [[Wikipedia:Gas giant|gas giant]] [[Ragnar]]. Ragnar was ideal because it was well protected, and ''Galactica'' could rearm after being disarmed for her decommissioning. While there, Adama found that no Colonial warships had responded to the call to regroup. Instead, the ''Galactica'' encountered a ragtag fleet of civilian vessels bearing around 50,000 survivors, including the former Secretary for Education and newly appointed President of the Colonies, [[Laura Roslin]].

Roslin implored Adama to abandon his plan to fight the Cylons and instead lead the survivors to safety, out of the Colonial system. Initially, Adama believed this idea to be preposterous – after all, he was a military man, bred to fight and not to run. However, after some deliberation, he agreed, realising that the survival of the human race was more important than the pursuit of vengeance in what would almost certainly be a suicidal counterattack against the Cylons; ''Galactica'' would only be one ship against an entire Cylon fleet. ''Galactica'' and her fleet [[Wikipedia:FTL (Battlestar Galactica)|jumped]] beyond the &quot;red line&quot; (the boundary beyond which FTL jump calculations become uncertain and therefore jumps become dangerous), never to return to the Twelve Colonies.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Miniseries_3-3&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Miniseries-3|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Thus, Adama found himself on the run in uncharted deep space. In order to give his men and the people of the fleet some hope, Adama lied to them, saying that he knew where the thirteenth colony, [[Wikipedia:Earth|Earth]], was located, and that he would lead them all there to make a new home. Even though ex-wife, Carolanne, was presumed to have died in the Cylon attack, Adama still harbored feelings for her and continued to wear his wedding band and observe their wedding anniversary for a time.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-A_Day_in_the_Life_14-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-A Day in the Life-14|[15]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

After an incident on the hangar deck that resulted in the deaths of several pilots, Adama became aware of the true details of his son Zak's death after Thrace let her affair with Zak cloud her judgment again by being too harsh on the replacement trainees. Adama was barely able to restrain himself upon learning of the cause of Zak's death from Thrace.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Act_of_Contrition_10-3&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Act of Contrition-10|[11]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Events following the revelation lead Adama and his surviving son Lee to commit a similar act of allowing feelings to cloud judgment after Thrace is shot down and stranded on an inhospitable planet. After Adama is compelled to abandon Thrace by President Roslin, Thrace miraculously rescues herself and returns to ''Galactica'' aboard a captured Cylon Raider. Adama forgives Thrace for her indiscretions concerning Zak. The incident also cements the father-son bond between William Adama and his surviving son. Lee questions how long his father would search for him were he missing, to which the elder Adama responds, &quot;if it were you... we'd never leave.&quot;&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-You_Can.27t_Go_Home_Again_15-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-You Can.27t Go Home Again-15|[16]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Soon after ''Galactica'' and the Colonial fleet discover the lost planet [[Kobol]], Adama is shot by [[Sharon Valerii|&quot;Boomer&quot;]], a Cylon sleeper agent, which places him in mortal jeopardy.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Kobol.27s_Last_Gleaming_16-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Kobol's Last Gleaming-16|[17]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Although he survives this assassination attempt, the brush with death changes him somewhat: some say that his more emotional leanings are a post-traumatic reaction to the shooting, but Adama jokes to Roslin that he thinks that he is &quot;just a wuss.&quot;&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Home_.28D.29_17-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Home .28D.29-17|[18]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

After the [[Pegasus|Battlestar ''Pegasus'']] encounters the fleet, Adama comes into conflict with Rear Admiral [[Wikipedia:Helena Cain|Helena Cain]], commander of the ''Pegasus'', over the treatment of two ''Galactica'' crew members, [[Karl Agathon]] and [[Galen Tyrol]]. Cain and Adama come to the brink of firing on each other.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Pegasus_18-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Pegasus-18|[19]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Each battlestar commander makes plans to have the other assassinated following the successful conclusion of a joint operation to destroy the [[Wikipedia:Cylon Resurrection ship|Cylon Resurrection ship]]. Neither plan is carried out (both commanders decide not to give the kill order), although Cain is subsequently killed by the Cylon agent [[Number Six|Gina]].&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Resurrection_Ship_19-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Resurrection Ship-19|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

With the death of Cain, Roslin promotes Adama to Admiral. Adama is surprised and touched: by this point in his career, he had given up hope of attaining [[Wikipedia:Flag rank|flag rank]]; he encourages Roslin, battling [[Wikipedia:Breast cancer|breast cancer]], to remain hopeful of a recovery. There was also a brief, sweet kiss between the two, initiated by Adama, which Roslin smiles at afterwards.

====New Caprica and the Second Exodus====
After the discovery of [[New Caprica]], Adama appears hesitant to establish a permanent settlement on the planet, but is over-ruled by the new President [[Gaius Baltar]].&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Lay_Down_Your_Burdens_20-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Lay Down Your Burdens-20|[21]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In the months that follow, his attitude slowly softens, and he begins to allow military personnel to muster out and settle on New Caprica.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Unfinished_Business_21-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Unfinished Business-21|[22]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

When the Cylons locate New Caprica after a year of no contact with the human race, Adama is forced reluctantly to flee with all the ships still in orbit.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Lay_Down_Your_Burdens_20-1&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Lay Down Your Burdens-20|[21]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Two thousand civilians and the Battlestars ''Galactica'' and ''Pegasus'' at half-strength.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Precipice_22-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Precipice-22|[23]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Undaunted, Adama sets about formulating a rescue plan for the humans trapped under Cylon rule. His unorthodox strategy (he even goes so far as to jump the ''Galactica'' into the atmosphere of New Caprica) is successful, but not without loss. Against his father's orders, Lee arrives in the Pegasus to join the battle and save ''Galactica'', but left all of its fighters behind to guard the civilian fleet. ''Pegasus'' takes heavy damage, forcing the crew to abandon ship. ''Pegasus'' is destroyed upon collision with a basestar. Adama returns to the fleet as a hero.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Exodus_23-0&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Exodus-23|[24]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Three years after the incident at the Armistice Line, ''Galactica'' recovers Lieutenant [[Wikipedia:List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)#Daniel &quot;Bulldog&quot; Novacek|Daniel &quot;Bulldog&quot; Novacek]], the pilot of the recon vessel that Adama ordered shot down when in command of the Battlestar ''Valkyrie''. Adama's guilt over the incident and suspicions that he may have provoked the Cylon attack on the Colonies lead him to tender his resignation from the Fleet: however, President Roslin refuses to accept his resignation. Moreover, in an attempt to improve fleet morale and reward Adama for his continual military service in ensuring the survival of the fleet, President Roslin awards Adama with a Medal of Distinction in recognition of his 45 years of service to the Colonial Fleet. Colonel Tigh is the one who saves Adama when Bulldog attacks the Admiral, seeking revenge for his capture, and this marks a turning point in the Adama-Tigh relationship: after the award ceremony, the two friends finally sit down to share a drink and talk about the events on New Caprica, and Ellen Tigh's death in particular.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Hero_6-4&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Hero-6|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Adama is initially supportive of the &quot;ranks dropped&quot; boxing competition held on ''Galactica'' with Colonel Tigh as referee, seeing it as a useful means of allowing the crew to vent their frustrations and prevent them growing into feuds and grudges. However, when he sees that some of the crew have taken to enjoying the competition over tending to their professional duties, he is reminded of how he himself softened during the year above New Caprica. He takes on Chief Galen Tyrol in the ring; although he is beaten by the younger man, his actions and words afterwards remind the crew of their solemn duty to guard the civilian fleet.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-Unfinished_Business_21-1&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-Unfinished Business-21|[22]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

After the fleet's food-processing systems become contaminated the fleet prepares to make a hazardous journey through a highly radioactive [[Wikipedia:Star cluster|stellar cluster]] in search of supplies, Tigh finally returns (a little self-consciously) to the ''Galactica'' CIC. Although Adama does not join the applause for the Colonel, he cannot hide a small smile. After the stellar cluster has been negotiated, he visits Captain [[Louanne Katraine|Louanne &quot;Kat&quot; Katraine]] on her deathbed after she receives a fatal dose of radiation guiding civilian ships through the cluster. He comforts her, telling her that her shady past life is irrelevant to him: he is interested only in her bravery and outstanding qualities as a leader, for which he (posthumously) returns her to the position of CAG.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-The_Passage_11-1&quot;&gt;[[Wikipedia:William Adama#cite note-The Passage-11|[12]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Upon reaching the Algae planet in a highly unstable planetary system the Colonials begin harvesting operations. Galen Tyrol informs Roslin and Adama of his discovery of an ancient temple, The Temple of Five which holds some significance in the Colonial religion. Roslin believes according to scripture that an artifact ''The Eye of Jupiter'' is hidden somewhere within the Temple and would act as a Marker on the way to Earth. The fleet is soon confronted by four Cylon Base Stars and Adama orders all civilian ships to jump away. Taking up a defense posture Adama prepares to engage the incoming Cylons with several people still on the planet and the possibility of the Cylons retrieving information on the location of Earth. The incoming Cylons on the advice of Gaius Baltar do not come in firing instead send a delegation to negotiate with Roslin and Adama for the ''Eye''. The brief negotiation leaves both sides in a stalemate, if the Cylons attack the ''Galactica'' or attempt to land on the planet Adama would nuke the temple, if the Colonials attempt to take the ''Eye'' the Cylons would attack. The Cylons eventually attempt to land on the planet and take the temple. Adama in response arms ''Galactica's'' nuclear warheads and targets them on the temple, nearly making good on his threat. The Cylons recall all but one of their heavy raiders forcing Adama to back down. When the star in the planetary system begins to show sign of going [[Wikipedia:Supernova|supernova]], Adama orders a rescue mission be launched to the planet. Retrieving all of her raptors, ''Galactica'' narrowly escapes the shock wave jumping back to her fleet.

====Mutiny====
After Adama starts considering not only an alliance with the Rebel Cylons, but to let them join the fleet. Lieutenant Felix Gaeta starts a mutiny against him with Tom Zarek who is captain of the prison ship ''[[Astral Queen]]'' starting a coup against Roslin and the rest of the government. Adama is initially unaware of the coup as Gaeta manages to hide it well, but when it becomes obvious that there is something wrong, Gaeta immediately arrests Adama who is nearly killed by an overzealous Marine but is saved by one of his crew who sacrifices his life for him. Adama promises no forgiveness for this mutiny and is taken away alongside Colonel Tigh. On the way Adama chats with the two Marines who are escorting him, one of whom is unsure about what he is doing, and overpowers them, killing one and taking the other prisoner. He tries to rescue the prisoners in the brig but its too well guarded and meets up with Lee and Kara who escaped and are working against the mutineers. They head to the Secondary Storage Airlock where Tyrol has promised a ride to a safe place for Adama, Tigh, Roslin and Baltar. There they meet up with a Raptor from the Cylon baseship who Tyrol apparently convinced to shelter them. Roslin and Baltar leave, but Adama decides to stay behind to cover their escape and try to retake the ship. Adama and Roslin, who recently entered a relationship with each other, share a kiss before Roslin and Baltar escape. Adama and Tigh try to hold off the approaching Marines but are knocked out by a stun grenade and recaptured. Tigh is taken to the brig while Gaeta (who is now in command after the mutiny and coup) tries to get Adama to get Roslin to surrender, but he sarcastically tells Gaeta that Gaeta is the Admiral now and he should tell Roslin that and make her laugh. Adama is later tried in an obviously rigged court-martial consisting of Gaeta as the people's representative, Tom Zarek as the judge and Romo Lampkin as his lawyer. He is tried for various crimes including treason, dereliction of duty (for abandoning the people on New Caprica) and aiding and abetting the enemy. Adama refuses to betray his beliefs and is heartbroken when he's told Tigh was killed trying to escape. Ultimately he is found guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad. Before he can be killed, however, he's rescued by Tigh, Lee, Athena, Caprica Six, Helo and Lieutenant Kelly who switched sides and told the others where he was. He is shocked but happy to see Tigh alive as the truth was Apollo and Starbuck rescued him and the others from the brig and no one was killed although Anders was seriously hurt. Adama prepares to take back his ship and asks Narcho and the firing squad for aid. The firing squad agrees, but Narcho refuses stating that despite respecting Adama he will not serve under someone who will help Cylons so Adama orders him tied up and marchs to CIC to retake it with his loyal men. Along the way they are joined by most of the crew and they reach CIC and retake it without firing a shot, arresting Gaeta and Zarek who are both there. Adama contacts a relieved Roslin on the baseship who thought he was dead and was about to start shooting ''Galactica'' and tells her and the Cylons to stand down. He later embraces her when she returns to ''Galactica''. Adama has Gaeta and Zarek executed by firing squad for their actions, a firing squad he personally commands. Command of the ''Astral Queen'' was left undecided after Zarek's execution.

After the mutiny, Tyrol shows him the deteriorating condition of ''Galactica'' and proposes using Cylon technology to make repairs. Adama initially refuses, but ultimately agrees to it reluctantly but has trouble letting go when he learns that all that Tyrol can do is buy some more time. Roslin points out that Adama is having trouble with the fact that he might lose the two women he loves at the same time (Roslin and ''Galactica'') and convinces him to abandon ship. During the preparations to abandon ''Galactica'', it is stated that Adama will be the last man aboard, and fly the last Viper off the ship himself.

===Rescue of Hera and finding a new home===
Adama eventually commands the ''Galactica'' on her final mission: an operation to rescue the half-human, half-cylon child Hera from the Cylon colony. He calls for volunteers and is able to rally enough of the crew and civilians to execute the mission. Delivering a final speech before the attack, he reminds the crew that the old ship will not fail them if they do not fail her, and that she will bring them home if they succeed. Adama and Tigh command the operation from CIC, and defend their position from Cylon boarders until the intervention of Gaius Baltar allows them to broker a truce. Adama agrees to allow Cavil's Cylon faction access to the resurrection technology held by the Final Five in return for a promise to never again assault humanity. The truce is broken when, while uploading the resurrection technology to the Cylons, [[Galen Tyrol]] discovers that [[Tory Foster]] was responsible for his wife's death and breaks the link in order to kill Foster. During the resumed hostilities, Adama shields [[Laura Roslin]] from the gunfire while the ''Galactica'' crew kills the Cavil faction Cylons present in the CIC. The Cylon colony is struck by a volley of nuclear warheads accidentally launched from a dead Raptor, and Adama orders Kara Thrace to jump the ship before ''Galactica'' is destroyed in the conflagration. Thrace uses the numerical sequence she created from the song [[Wikipedia:All Along the Watchtower|All Along the Watchtower]] and ''Galactica'' jumps to the planet that will eventually be known as [[Earth]], but sustains irreparable damage to her lateral support braces in the process.

A Raptor is sent to rendezvous with the Colonial fleet, which is then brought to the new planet. After surveying the primitive humans of their new home, Adama adopts a colonizing strategy proposed by his son Lee: the colonials abandon most of their technology and settle in widely separated locations on the planet. The emptied ships of the fleet, including ''Galactica'', are piloted into the sun by the Cylon [[Samuel Anders]], who had been plugged into the battlestar's computer systems. As he had planned earlier, William Adama is the last person to leave ''Galactica'', launching aboard the Mk. II Viper with his call sign that had appeared in the original mini-series.

After bidding a tearful goodbye to his son [[Leland Adama|Lee]], and to (the avatar of) [[Kara Thrace]], whom he'd considered a daughter, Adama takes the dying [[Laura Roslin]] on a Raptor flight over their new homeworld, searching for a spot to build the cabin they had talked about on New Caprica. Roslin dies during the flight, as foretold by the prophecy, and Adama tearfully places his wedding ring on her finger. In his final scene in the series, Adama is depicted sitting next to Roslin's grave, describing the progress he has made in building their cabin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10902">'''Laura Roslin''' serves as the Secretary of Education at the time of the Cylon attack and later serves twice as President of the Twelve Colonies despite never being elected to office. She is also believed by some in the Fleet to be a religious figure essential to the fulfillment of the Pythian prophecy.

==Biography==
===Background===
Some time before the Fall of the Twelve Colonies, Roslin is forced to take care of her dying mother, who is going through doloxan treatments for cancer. At some point, Roslin's father and sisters are killed in a car accident at the fault of a drunk driver. Like her mother, Roslin is a schoolteacher, though she enters politics under the mayoral administration of Richard Adar. When Adar decides to run for president, Roslin reluctantly agrees to join his campaign, and is later appointed as Secretary of Education.

Though Roslin never marries, she engages in a sexual affair with the married Adar. The day of the Cylon attack, Roslin learns that she has terminal breast cancer. Returning to work, Roslin informs Adar that she has successfully resolved an ongoing teacher's strike, but Adar vehemently disagrees with her method, and asks for her resignation. She asks him to defer the matter until she returns from the decommissioning ceremonies of the Galactica.

===Fall of the Colonies===
Roslin travels to ''Galactica'' aboard the government-chartered civilian transport, Colonial Heavy 798, accompanied by a government aide, Billy Keikeya. On board Galactica, Secretary Roslin meets with Commander Adama, who denies her request to add a student computer network in the battlestar. Roslin lets the matter go and departs the ship following the decommissioning ceremonies.
Roslin being sworn in

On route back to Caprica, Roslin learns from the captain that the Cylons are attacking the Twelve Colonies. Roslin quickly takes on the mantle of leadership, rallying the passengers to make space for potential refugees. She finally establishes contact with a government official on Caprica, who does not know the the whereabouts or condition of President Adar. As the transport begins to rescue survivors from a stranded passenger vessel, the Case Orange automated beacon is picked up on the wireless, and Roslin instructs the pilot to respond to the message with her government identification. Soon, a response returns from the automated message: Roslin, the forty-third official in line of succession, is the highest-ranking government official left alive and thus has succeeded Adar as president. Physically shaking, Roslin holds back tears and her voice cracks as the priestess Elosha administers the oath of office.

In her first act as president, Roslin orders the ''Galactica'' to assist her in rescue operations. In turn, Adama refuses to recognize her authority and orders the vessel to rendezvous with ''Galactica'' at the Ragnar Anchorage. The two are interrupted by a pair of Cylon Raiders, which launch nuclear missiles at the small fleet Roslin has assembled. She refuses to leave the vessels behind and is only saved by quick thinking on the part of Lee Adama. Soon after, a Galactica Raptor carrying Dr. Gaius Baltar locates Roslin's ship, the newly rechristened ''Colonial One''. Roslin appoints Baltar as her chief science advisor and uses the Raptor to locate any surviving ships around Caprica. Over the next few hours, Roslin's small group of ships transforms into a massive fleet harboring over 50,000 survivors.

While attempting to transfer passengers off of all non-FTL capable ships, the Fleet is discovered by another pair of Raiders. Forced to make a difficult decision, Roslin orders all FTL-capable ships to jump to Ragnar, abandoning the thousands of people still aboard the sub-light ships. At Ragnar, Roslin meets again with Adama and urges him to abandon the Twelve Colonies in favor of guiding the surviving civilians to a new home. Though Adama initially rejects this idea, he later acquiesces and the Fleet, protected by ''Galactica'', leaves Colonial space.

In an attempt to give the survivors a reason to survive, Adama claims that he knows the location of Earth, the home of the Thirteenth Tribe. Roslin privately calls Adama out on his lie. Adama admits the deception, and in return for Roslin keeping his secret and allowing him to retain control of the military, he acknowledges Roslin's authority over the civilian fleet as president.

===The First Month===
Roslin begins building the foundations of a civilian government by collecting a census on the remaining population while Cylon attacks force the Fleet to jump every 33 minutes. Working tirelessly throughout these attacks without any sleep, Roslin is forced to make another tough call and authorizes Galactica to destroy the ''Olympic Carrier'', a ship suspected of being tracked by the Cylons. Ultimately, the destruction of the ship ends the attacks, yet Roslin continues to question whether she had made the right choice considering the 1300 lives lost on the ship.

Though Roslin and Adama continue to have a wary relationship, Adama integrates her into the decision process. Roslin and Adama agree to keep the knowledge that Cylons now appear human a secret. She later authorizes the conditional pardoning of prisoners aboard the ''Astral Queen''. However, Tom Zarek, a former terrorist with a political agenda, successfully frees the prisoners, takes control of the ship and broadcasts calls for Roslin to step down from office and hold immediate elections. Roslin refuses to negotiate and presses Adama for an armed response, though she is less than pleased when Lee ends the situation by giving the prisoners control of their ship and promising that the scheduled presidential elections would take place in nine months.

Having appointed Lee as her military liaison, she admits the truth of her cancer to him. She later seeks treatment from ''Galactica'''s doctor, Sherman Cottle, though she opts to use an alternative, psychoactive drug, chamalla, rather than endure the same doloxan treatments that she had watched her mother suffer through.

Following a suicide bombing aboard ''Galactica'' by copy of Aaron Doral, Roslin holds a press conference revealing the truth about humanoid Cylons and releasing pictures of Aaron Doral and Leoben Conoy. The news is greeted with a stunned reaction throughout the Fleet. A resulting independent investigation aboard ''Galactica'' is launched by Adama, though Roslin cautions against this course of action.

As a result of her press conference regarding the Cylons, a copy of Leoben Conoy is captured aboard the ''Gemenon Traveler''. Despite Adama's desire to kill him immediately, Roslin insists he be interrogated. When Conoy claims that he has planted a nuclear bomb within the Fleet, Roslin travels to the ''Gemenon Traveler'' and stops the torture being inflicted on him. Agreeing to release him if he tells her where the bomb is, Conoy informs her that there is no bomb and that Adama is a Cylon. She subsequently orders him to be thrown out of an airlock, a method of execution repeated multiple times over the course of Roslin's administration. While Roslin becomes suspicious of Adama as a result of Conoy's claim, her fears are allayed by Baltar's invention of a Cylon detector.

Soon after, Roslin reconstitutes the Quorum of Twelve aboard ''Cloud Nine''. However, the election of Zarek as the Sagittaron delegate disrupts her agenda when Zarek insists on the election of a vice president. The delegate from Virgon nominates Zarek, while Roslin chooses Wallace Gray as her preferred candidate. However, Gray fails to win enough support in the Quorum to defeat Zarek and is replaced at the last minute by Baltar, the Caprican delegate. The resulting vote is a tie, which allows Roslin to cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of Baltar.

===Kobol===
Shortly before the capture of Leoben Conoy, Roslin has a set of visions that are uncannily prescient to future events. During a press conference soon after, she hallucinates a dozen snakes crawling over her podium. Disturbed by these events, she consults Elosha and admits that she has been using chamalla. On hearing about the snakes, Elosha reveals that it matches a prophecy in an ancient text written by Pythia 3,600 years ago concerning the exodus of humankind, which foretells that a dying leader will guide the remnants of humanity to the promised land.

Cottle informs Roslin that her cancer has spread to her lymphatic system, giving her perhaps six months to live. Soon after, a recon mission from ''Galactica'' discovers a habitable world with ruins across the surface. Reviewing the photos of the ruins, Roslin has another vision that Elosha confirms to be the City of the Gods on Kobol. Roslin has two further visions of the Arrow of Apollo and the Tomb of Athena and accepts the scriptures as fact. Though Adama considers permanent settlement on the planet, Roslin tries to convince him they should use a captured Cylon Raider to return to Caprica and retrieve the Arrow of Apollo, which would open the Tomb of Athena and point the way to Earth. Uncomfortable with Roslin's newfound religiousness, Adama asserts his authority over the military to deny her the use of the Raider.

Resolved, Roslin convinces Kara Thrace to steal the Raider and return to Caprica by admitting that Adama does not know where Earth is. Upon learning of her deception, Adama asks Roslin for her resignation; her refusal results in him sending a Marine boarding party to ''Colonial One'' to arrest her. Though Lee Adama ultimately sides with the President during the armed standoff, Roslin agrees to surrender to prevent bloodshed. Adama is shot soon after by a Cylon agent, and Saul Tigh assumes command of ''Galactica'' and refuses Roslin's request to be released.

From her cell, Roslin rallies support from the Quorum of Twelve by convincing them of her role in the Sacred Scrolls in response, Tigh dissolves the Quorum and declares martial law. With the help of several sympathetic crew members of ''Galactica'', Roslin escapes with Lee and hides within the Fleet with the help of Zarek. Declaring herself publicly to be the &quot;dying leader&quot; foretold by Pythia, Roslin asks the Fleet to follow her back to Kobol. Nearly a third of the Fleet heeds her request and jumps back to Kobol, where they rendezvous with Starbuck and the recovered Arrow. A search party led by Roslin heads to the surface and Elosha is soon killed by a landmine, which deeply shakes Roslin.

A recon team led by Adama intercepts Roslin's group, and Adama and Roslin resolve their differences, with Adama agreeing to help her find the Tomb. After locating it, the group places the Arrow in the bow of a statue of Sagittarius, which activates a projection showing the way to Earth. Upon returning to the Fleet, Adama reinstates Roslin as president.

{{quote|You know, everyone I know is fighting to get back what they had. I'm fighting because I don't know how to do anything else.|Kara about her career.}}
'''Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace''' is a [[Viper]] pilot in the [[Colonial Fleet]]. She is a gifted Viper pilot, with an attitude that at times thwarts her career advancement.

==History==

Kara was born on [[Picon]], but she was raised all over the twelve colonies. The daughter of a career enlisted woman, her childhood was spent bouncing from one military outpost to another. Kara's father, [[Dreilide]], was a frustrated musician, forever trying to write songs and make it into the big time and forever failing to make his mark. Her mother, Socrata, was a Sergeant Major in the [[Colonial Marines]], attached to an artillery company and a decorated veteran of the [[Cylon War]].

Kara was a tough and tough-minded child, more interested in sports than in the military, she dreamed of playing Pyramid in the big leagues someday. At every base, there was a Pyramid court and Kara was a born athlete, able to both slice and duck around opponents on her way to planting the slippery ball into the goal or to block and tackle the opposing players on defense. Her mother had won the Star of Valor in the Cylon War and this honor entitled her daughter to a place at the Fleet Academy if she wanted it. At first, Kara wasn't interested and wanted to pursue a college scholarship, but her school records were spotty at best. Finally realizing that the Academy had one of the best Pyramid teams at the collegiate level, Kara decided to enter the Academy, serve her three years required enlistment and then resign and pursue a professional Pyramid career.

Kara played Pyramid well at the Academy, and was being actively scouted by the major league teams when a vicious hit shattered her right knee during a playoff game in her sophomore year. Even after months of reconstructive surgeries and physical therapy, it was clear that the leg would never be the same. Kara would have to look for a different career.

Depressed, she applied to all the various post-graduate training schools, but doubted she'd be accepted to any of them with her academic record. But to her shock, she scored higher on the flight training entrance exam than anyone in the history of the program and she was accepted into the next class.

Kara was what the instructors called a true stick and rudder woman; someone who flew by instinct not instruction. To her own surprise, Kara found herself in love with flying. She'd never thought that anything could equal the feeling she had on the Pyramid court, but flying actually surpassed it. She found a freedom in the air she'd never experienced before, a joy and effortlessness that was new and welcome into her hardscrabble life. All thoughts of leaving the service after three years were gone. She would be a pilot for the rest of her life - that is, unless she was kicked out of the Fleet.

Kara hated taking orders. Hated military protocol. Hated the rules and regulations that were part and parcel of the military life. Her record at the Academy and then at flight school was littered with demerits, reprimands, and negative evaluations by her superiors. She drank too much, gambled too much, broke curfew almost daily, somehow always managed to be involved in any bar fight at the local watering holes and had a reputation for leaving a string of men with broken hearts and broken backs after sexual encounters that were more akin to a game of tackle Pyramid than lovemaking. Simply put, she was a disaster as a military officer. But no one could argue with her flying. While her academic and personal record kept her from graduating first in her class, she set new records on almost every hands-on flying test she encountered. Clearly, she was destined to fly Vipers and just as clearly she would be a handful for any squadron leader unfortunate to have her under their command.

Kara served her first tour aboard the battlestar [[Triton]] and while she was loved and admired by the other pilots, she was reviled by the ship's commander, who wanted her off the Triton as soon as possible. What to do with her became a problem, since no other ship would take her. Fortunately, a slot opened up as an instructor at flight school and Kara was immediately shipped right back where she started.

It was there that Kara met Zak Adama and fell in love for the first time in her life. There'd never been a lack of men in her life, but she'd never seriously considered the possibility of a long-term relationship. Zak was different. Something about him touched and moved Kara, made her want to break all the rules of the heart she'd lived by all her life.

When she met Zak's brother [[Lee Adama|Lee]], she briefly thought she'd made a profound mistake. While Zak touched her maternal instincts, made her want to protect and nurture the shy, young pilot, his brother touched her in a deeper and more womanly way. Lee Adama's entire carriage and attitude was a challenge to Kara Thrace, and Kara Thrace had never walked away from a challenge. But then the weekend passed, and Lee left to rejoin his squadron, and Kara firmly put aside the feelings as the momentary wandering of a rogue's heart.

Then Zak failed a key flight test. A test Kara was administering. Zak was on the bubble as far as flight school was concerned and failing this test was a sure ticket out. It was Kara's duty to fail him. But she couldn't do it, couldn't destroy Zak's dream of becoming a pilot like his father. She passed him and made a promise to herself that she would teach Zak everything he needed to know and make sure he became a great pilot.

It wasn't enough. The board of inquiry determined that Zak Adama's plane had crashed due to &quot;pilot error.&quot; Kara was devastated, bereft, ready to resign her commission right after Zak's funeral. But that day, Zak's father sought out Kara and asked the woman who was almost his daughter-in-law to stand with the family at the gravesite. She stood next to Commander Adama in the bright sunshine of the [[Caprica]]n morning and felt his arm go around her when tears began to stream down her cheeks and a bond was formed between them. Adama asked her to join him as a pilot aboard the Galactica and Kara readily agreed. She spent the next two years aboard [[Galactica]], for the most part managing to stay out of the brig and concentrating on just flying. Adama kept an eye on her and the two of them became more like father and daughter than pilot and commander.

==Characteristics and personality==
{{quote|Remember, we're all flying solo on this mission. So that means there'll be nobody there to bitch slap you if you start to get tired or start seeing little toasters on your wing.|Kara briefing the pilots.}}
Kara thinks with her nerve endings. She not only wears her heart on her sleeve, she'll throw it at you if you're not paying attention. A rule-breaker by nature and a hell-raiser by preference, she nevertheless not only respects, but reveres the traditions and customs of the military service. Few things are guaranteed to bring a tear to her eye more than hearing the Colonial anthem and watching the flag go up the halyard.

She is proud of her uniform, proud of her place in the long tradition of pilots who've gone before, and is politically conservative to the point of being almost reactionary. She's also loyal to a fault, and fiercely protective of her friends and family.

{{Quote|I'll tell you the secret to avoid hangovers. Don't stop drinking.|Saul on drinking.}}

'''Saul''' is a [[Cylon]], one of the [[Final Five]].

==Early life==
==Annihilation of Mankind==
==Occupation on New Caprica==
Saul was the leader of the resistance against the cylons that occupied [[New Caprica]]. While he was held in one of the Cylon camps for questions and torture, one of the cylons ripped out his right eye.

==Post New Caprica==
After being saved from the operation on New Caprica, Saul tumbled into an angry, vengeful, drunken stupor. The fact that he killed his wife and the other acts he committed on New Caprica is to blame. Eventually, he manages to overcome these feelings and returns as the XO of the [[Galactica]].

==Final Five==
It was revealed on the [[season 3]] finale that Colonel Tigh was one of the final five cylons. To say the least, he was not happy to find himself to be that which he has hated his whole life.

==Episode Digest==
This episodes starts out on [[Galactica]] with Lieutenant [[Sharon Valerii]] (aka Boomer) Sitting in a store room completely soaked with water. At first she doesn't realise what's going on. Snapping back into reality and looking around bewildered she finds a duffle back with a spare uniform with her name on it. Quickly changing she finds G-4 Explosives, marked with detonator #A-7, in the same pack and quickly disassembles it. After Changing Boomer enters the D2 Repair Bay where one of the specialists approaches and informers her that it is 05:45 in the morning subtly implying that her behaviour is odd (particularly the sleeping aspect). From there the Lieutenant sneaks off the the Small Arms Locker quickly enters the code and slips inside in order to return the explosives. While doing so she finds that detonators #A-1 through #A-6 are also missing yet she has no idea where they are. There is a quick flash of them activating, though not detonating, along a ship and the opening credits roll

The last scene cuts to Various crew members preparing for the day. Colonel Saul Tigh Measure how much liquor he has left. [[Leland Adama|Captain Adama]] opening his personal locker and having a flashback to the take down of the ''Olympic Carrier'' that he had carried out the day before. This results in him seeking counsel from his father, Commander [[William Adama]] about whether or not they had made the right choice.

A short scene brings us to [[Colonial One]] Docking in ''Galactica'' with President [[Laura Roslin]] being breifed about her boarding ceremony, which she admittantly dislikes but deems necesarry.

Returning to Boomer on the Repair Bay, she takes a moment to talk with Chief [[Galen Tyrol]] admitting that there is a problem.

At the same time The President and Commander discuss their Plan for water rations.

Tyrol consoles Boomer stating, &quot;Whatever it is we're going to take care of it ok, alright?&quot; prompting her to spill that there are six G-4 Detonators missing. Tyrol freaks out and states that she need to report it higher up but she confesses that everyone will think she took them.

Petty Officer [[Anastasia Dualla]] gets hit on by the Presidents aide but she just laughs it off.

Boomer recounts her discover and Tyrol is just blown away (figuratively speaking) by the situation. Tyrol shrugs it off as a set up, Valarii points out [[Cylon]] sleeper agents in the fleet and and explosion abruptly ends their conversation. The explosion was a rupter in the water supply tanks causing approximately 60% of the water to flow freely into the vaccum or space. The Colony is placed on emergency rations.

A team consisting scouts the damage finding a scorched plate that shows signs of explosives and sabatoge but Tyrol dismisses it as rusted.

==Summary==

== Part 2

After an 18-hour standoff on Caprica with the Cylons, Starbuck's rescue team finds that their enemy has completely withdrawn.

At the fleet, Cally is recovering from her beating by Chief Tyrol. Tyrol apologizes to Cally who forgives him and reveals that she has feelings for him. Roslin secretly meets with Baltar and asks that he table his idea for settling the planet he calls &quot;[[New Caprica]]&quot; until after the election. Baltar refuses, to Roslin's dismay. She then confronts him about seeing him on Caprica with the blond Cylon woman, recalling her deathbed vision. Though visibly shaken by Laura's accusation, Baltar knows she has no proof and deflects her questioning.

When Starbuck's rescue team returns to Galactica, an alarmed Chief Tyrol notices a copy of Brother Cavil among the rescued Caprican survivors and alerts security. The man admits to being a Cylon and is taken to the brig along with Sharon Agathon, who knew Cavil was a Cylon agent and didn't warn them. Sharon later explains to Helo that she didn't warn them because she believes Adama killed her baby and that she no longer cares what happens to her.

Starbuck and Anders get reacquainted in a bunk room. Commander Apollo enters to introduce himself to Anders, but a drunken Starbuck barely acknowledges Apollo's presence and makes crude remarks about his new relationship with Petty Officer Dualla.

Roslin meets with the Cylon man who is joined in the brig by his sarcastic twin, Brother Cavil. The Cylon man brings the message that two Cylon &quot;heroes&quot; (a Number Six and Number Eight who they identify as the resurrected Boomer), have convinced the rest of the Cylons that the attack on the Colonies, along with the pursuit of the fleet, were errors. They state that the Cylons need to find their own unique path to enlightenment and have decided to offer humanity a &quot;reprieve&quot;. Roslin and Adama are skeptical and Roslin orders they be vented into space.

On election day, Baltar has a 5,000 vote lead over Roslin until the final batch of votes from the Zephyr are counted. Roslin wins the election against all predictions. Lt. Gaeta, who was in charge of the ballot counting, spots a major irregularity with the Zephyr's ballot papers and reports the matter to Col. Tigh. The truth is that Tigh himself, in collusion with Dualla and Tory Foster (Roslin's campaign assistant), has rigged the election in favor of Roslin. Gaeta takes the matter directly to Admiral Adama.

Adama confronts Roslin who admits she knew that Foster was planning to rig the vote. She stresses that Baltar cannot become President because he is working for the Cylons, explaining to Adama what she saw back on Caprica. He is shocked at her claims and though he has no wish to see Baltar as President he insists the vote rigging was illegal and would eventually weigh heavily on her conscience.

Roslin reluctantly cedes the victory to Baltar. Adama explains to Baltar that the original vote count was a &quot;tabulating error&quot;. Baltar knows this isn't true but decides to let the matter rest and orders Adama to take the fleet to New Caprica.

Baltar later meets with Gina and tells her they can live together at the new settlement, but she says she isn't going. Baltar goes to Colonial One to be sworn in as President. Gina sets off the nuclear warhead that Baltar gave her terrorist group. The detonation destroys [[Cloud Nine]] and a few other ships caught within the blast radius.

The next scene opens one year later where the people of the fleet have settled &quot;[[New Caprica City]]&quot;. Above New Caprica, the remaining larger ships orbit with only skeleton crews. These include Galactica where Admiral Adama is now assisted by Helo, and Pegasus, where Commander Apollo is now assisted by Dualla. The battlestars are no longer being maintained in combat-ready condition.

President Baltar has turned Colonial One into a messy bachelor pad. Gaeta works diligently as his aide, though Baltar largely ignores him. Laura Roslin has returned to teaching and works inside a makeshift school assisted by Maya. Tyrol is now the leader of a disgruntled worker union denouncing the deplorable conditions the people face under President Baltar. At his side is a pregnant Cally.

Anders, now married to Starbuck, is currently bedridden with pneumonia. Dr. Cottle has no more antibiotics left to give him, but Tigh tells Starbuck that Apollo has antibiotics stored away as a medical reserve on Pegasus for his pilots. Starbuck reluctantly calls Apollo, but neither seem to wish to talk to each other. Before Apollo can respond to Starbuck's request, a fleet of Cylon ships suddenly jumps in. Admiral Adama is reluctant to abandon those on New Caprica but Apollo, knowing that they are outmatched, convinces him to jump away, leaving New Caprica undefended.

Gaeta rushes to inform President Baltar that the Cylons have appeared and that the fleet has jumped away. The Cylons fly over New Caprica in force and proceed to occupy the human settlement. The Cylon Leoben Conoy searches for Starbuck but finds only the bedridden Anders.

President Baltar meets with the Cylons who insist they will not attack unless the humans resist. They explain that New Caprica was found by accident when they detected, from over a light-year away, the signature of the nuclear explosion which destroyed Cloud Nine. With no other option, President Baltar surrenders to the Cylons on behalf of the people of New Caprica. Meanwhile, Starbuck, Tigh, Tyrol, Cally and others watch as Cylon Centurions march through the New Caprica settlement, and vow to resist.==

==Summary==
&quot;The Cylons were created by man.&quot;

&quot;They where created to make life easier on the Twelve Colonies&quot;

&quot;And then the day came when the cylons decided to kill their masters.&quot;

&quot;After a long bloody battle an armistice was declared.&quot;

This miniseries is the Reboot of [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 Series)|Battlestar Galactica]]. It is the Introduction to the whole series and follows the sole servivors of the human race and last of their fleet Battlestar ''Galactica''. It is broken up into two parts 1 and [[Miniseries, Night 2|2]] . Within this introductive mini series we see the catastophic attack by [[Cylons]], human created AI turned rogue, return after 40 years of absence. The attack is aimed to wipe Humans from existance.
After a 40-year armistice in a war between the Twelve Colonies (the homeworlds populated by humans) and the Cylons ([[human-created robots]]), the Cylons launch a surprise nuclear attack intended to exterminate the human race. Virtually all of the population of the Twelve Colonies are wiped out. Most of the Colonial military is either rendered ineffective or destroyed due to malware in the military computer network, which rendered it vulnerable to cyber attack.

The Cylon infiltrator programmed backdoors into the CNP so that the Cylon attack forces could render any ships that use the operating system to shut itself down by a remote command.

Battlestars and fighters begin to shut down during the Colonial defensive &quot;as if a switch were flipped.&quot;[3] Communications officer Dualla describes reports of &quot;system failures&quot; throughout the Fleet and how at least one battlestar loses power when the attack begins, which indicates, that the Cylons use the [[Command Navigation Program,CNP]] to damage and, in at least one case, disable capital ships as wel

The malware was introduced by [[Number Six]], a Cylon in the form of a [[human woman]], who seduced the famous scientist [[Dr. Gaius Baltar|Dr. Gaius ]][[Baltar ]]and exploited their relationship to gain access codes under the cover of an insider contract bid.

The [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 Series)|Battlestar Galactica,]] a space battleship that fought in the earlier war, is being converted to a museum when the attack occurs. Because its older computer systems are not networked, the warship is not affected by the sabotage. Its commander, William Adama, assumes command of the few remaining elements of the human fleet. He heads for[[Ragnar Anchorage| Ragnar Anchorage]], a military armory station where Galactica can resupply itself with weaponry and essential supplies.

&lt;br /&gt;
[[Caprica]] under bombardment during the [[Cylon attack]].

Secretary of Education [[Laura Roslin]] is sworn in as President of the [[Twelve Colonies]] after it is confirmed that the President and most of the government have been killed (Roslin is 43rd in line of succession). The cabinet department starship carrying her (Colonial One) manages to assemble a group of surviving human ships.

When a [[Colonial Raptor]] from Galactica lands briefly for repairs on the Twelve Colonies' capital world of Caprica, the two-person crew, [[Sharon Valerii]] (callsign &quot;[[Boomer]]&quot;) and [[Karl Agathon]] (&quot;[[Helo]]&quot;), choose a small group of survivors to evacuate. Helo decides to remain on the stricken planet, giving up his seat to evacuate Baltar, who he recognizes for his pseudo-celebrity status as a scientific genius.

Although Roslin hopes to transfer all the surviving refugees to ships capable of interstellar travel, the [[Cylons]] quickly locate and attack the surviving ships
Within this first half we are introduced to main characters as they prepare for the decommission of the battlestar, it was to be turned into a musem until the Cylon attack on [[Caprica]] is carried out. A bit of the Battlestars history is filled in and back storry is frequenlty mentioned for plot support so we aren't left wondering about a few things.

==Summary==
Roslin is forced to abandon many of the survivors, as only the ships capable of faster-than-light ([[FTL]]) &quot;jumps&quot; are able to escape the attack and rendezvous with the Galactica at Ragnar Anchorage.

On Ragnar, [[Adama]] is attacked by a supposed arms-dealer who claims to be simply bootlegging supplies, but who is clearly being affected by the radiation cloud surrounding Ragnar, which humans are immune to. Adama deduces that he is facing a new type of Cylon that looks, sounds and acts human.

Roslin appoints Baltar, who has not disclosed his suborning by the Cylons, as one of her senior advisers. [[Number Six]] reveals herself to Baltar in hallucinatory form while attempting to direct his behavior. The reason why she appears to him is not clear although she suggests that she may have planted a microchip inside Baltar's brain while he slept, allowing her to transmit her image into his conscious mind. Responding to one of her suggestions, he is compelled to identify ,[[Number Five]] (Aaron [[Doral]]), a public relations specialist, as a Cylon agent masquerading as a human. Despite his protests and the lack of any evidence to support the accusation, Doral is left on [[Ragnar Anchorage]] when the Galactica departs.

As the Cylons attack Ragnar, the small human fleet escapes by &quot;jumping&quot; to a distant, unexplored area of the galaxy. Adama attempts to lift the morale of the surviving humans by announcing plans to reach a legendary thirteenth colony, &quot;Earth,&quot; whose existence and location have been closely guarded military secrets. Roslin later convinces Adama to privately admit that his announcement was simply a ploy as she believes Earth to be a myth.

Adama finds a slip of paper in his quarters with the typed statement, &quot;There are only 12 Cylon models.&quot; On Ragnar, Doral clearly appears to be suffering from radiation poisoning that has been shown to affect only Cylons. His identity as a Cylon is confirmed when a group of Cylons, including the metallic Cylon Centurions and several humanoid Cylons consisting of multiple copies of the [[Number Six]], [[Doral]], and [[Ragnar]] arms-dealer models, come to retrieve Doral. In a twist ending, one of the group appears to be Boomer, indicating that her counterpart on the Galactica is a Cylon as well

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4291">Plot

During a celebration of one of the pilots' 1000th landing, a recon drone is accidentally launched (due to metal fatigue and old age of the components) into a crowd of pilots, killing thirteen. Starbuck is assigned to quickly train replacements (who are referred to as &quot;nuggets&quot;) from among the civilians, who have little to no flying experience. The senseless losses are a blow to the morale of the remaining Galactica pilots.

Elsewhere, President Laura Roslin has a checkup with the ship's medical officer, Dr. Cottle. Cottle tells Roslin her cancer is inoperable and gives her a few months to live. He recommends a powerful medication that can help her, but having watched her mother suffer from using it, she knows it is not without its side effects. Roslin wishes to explore alternate treatment with an unproven plant extract, &quot;Kamala,&quot; a request that Cottle receives skeptically. In a rare moment of emotional openness, he suggests she try prayer as an alternative.

Meanwhile, Starbuck's training assignment brings back painful memories of the unfortunate death of her fiancé, Zak Adama. Starbuck feels responsible for Zak's death since she had passed him for Basic Flight despite knowing he wasn't good enough to be a Viper pilot. She temporarily escapes the feelings with a card game between Lt. Crashdown, Lt. Felix Gaeta and Dr. Baltar, during which Galactica-Boomer catches word about Baltar's &quot;Cylon Detector&quot;.

Starbuck takes aggressive control of her class of nuggets, seemingly driven out of anger and regret over the loss of not only the thirteen pilots, but also her guilt in having been lax in training with Zak Adama. The nuggets include Louanne &quot;Kat&quot; Katraine and Brendan &quot;Hot Dog&quot; Constanza. Because of the lack of flight simulators, the nuggets are thrown into the cockpit of actual Vipers on their first day. Though all of them manage to survive, Starbuck flunks them all. Lee Adama inadvertently reveals to Cmdr. Adama that Starbuck may have had something to do with Zak's death. Cmdr. Adama confronts Starbuck, telling her to &quot;Cut the BS,&quot; and finally Starbuck confesses what she did for Zak. As a result, Cmdr. Adama and Starbuck's relationship is seriously strained. Hurt and angered by her actions, he orders her to return (saying &quot;while you still can...&quot; in a veiled threat he makes out of his tremendous grief) the nuggets to flight status and complete their training.

Skirmish over the Red Moon

During a training exercise, a Cylon Raider patrol shows up and attacks. Starbuck orders the trainees back to Galactica while she holds off the entire patrol. However, Hot Dog disobeys and stays to help her, referencing her earlier instruction to &quot;Never leave your squad leader.&quot; The last surviving raider is damaged by Starbuck at the last moment, leaving her with a heavily damaged Viper. Both craft hurtle out of control towards a nearby planet and enter the atmosphere. Starbuck goes into a flat spin and she punches out, free-falling along with the Viper.

Meanwhile, on Caprica, Helo and Sharon Valerii track the signal they picked up to its source; a restaurant with am underground bomb shelter filled with food, water and anti-radiation medication{{Television episode infobox

==Summary==
There's a party on Galactica's flight deck as [[Flat-Top]] just had his thousandth landing. Something goes terribly wrong however when a drone accidentally goes off and explodes in a group of pilots. 13 are dead. During the ceremony [[Kara Thrace]] starts thinking about her dead fiancée [[Zak Adama]]. And those memories even get clearer when Adama orders her to start training new pilots. She seems very uncomfortable in doing so. The favor she did for Zak by letting him pass basic flight seems to bother her more and more. Angrily she stops training pilots after just one day. Meanwhile on Cylon-occupied [[Caprica]] Helo and Cylon-Sharon find a bomb shelter in a restaurant. It seems like a good place to stay for a while. There's food, water and anti-radiation medication in abundance.

==Summary==
Plot

Starbuck is forced to bail out over an inhospitable planet after her Viper was badly damaged during a dog fight with a Cylon Raider. On Galactica, one of the pilots reports that Starbuck's Viper was still maneuvering and may have survived. Commander Adama goes against the reservations of Col. Tigh to organize a rescue mission to find her.

Starbuck finds herself stranded on a barren world with an inhospitable atmosphere. With a badly injured knee, she struggles to get to high ground hoping a Galactica search team can spot her. She sees the Cylon Raider that attacked her, disabled but intact, sitting nearby. She forces open its hatch discovering that the interior resembles the internal organs of a creature rather a machine. She uses the inside of the ship as a shelter as her suit oxygen begins to run low.

Back on Galactica, the search for Starbuck is going badly. Visibility around the planet is poor and the Vipers are burning up huge amounts of fuel during atmospheric recon ops. The planet's dusty conditions are causing mechanical problems, grounding many of the ships. President Roslin is startled when she hears that Adama has also pulled the Vipers out of the fleet's Combat Air Patrol (CAP) in order to join the search. President Roslin confronts Adama and his son, Lee. The reason Adama will not give up the search is that Starbuck is the final link to his dead son, Zak Adama. He realizes the search must be abandoned and the fleet should jump away as soon as possible.

Meanwhile, Starbuck finds an oxygen supply within the raider and begins to hack away at muscle and tendon-like tendrils. She finds what appear to be the controls and teaches herself how to operate it. She manages to activate the ship's drives and escapes the planet to return to the fleet. As final jump preparations are underway, the Galactica suddenly detects the incoming Cylon Raider on DRADIS. It will be on top of the fleet before they can jump; Adama is forced to halt the jump countdown and launches the alert fighters.

Capt. Apollo attempts to shoot down the raider in his Viper, but fails as it seems unusually skillful and agile. The raider pulls overhead and begins flying in formation with Apollo. After spotting the words &quot;Star&quot; and &quot;Buck&quot; spelled out in insulation tape under the Raider's wings, Apollo realizes who the pilot is, and escorts the raider to the hangar deck. Safe on Galactica, Adama and Starbuck reconcile over Zak's death.

Meanwhile, on Caprica, Helo and Caprica-Boomer hide out at the shelter until a Cylon patrol arrives. During the Cylon Centurion attack, Helo and Boomer become separated. When Helo regains consciousness in the shelter after the attack, he desperately searches for her but there is no sign of Boomer. Helo is unaware that he himself is being watched by the Cylons.

==Summary==
Plot

In the episode, the humans capture a fuel-rich asteroid from the Cylons using a plan devised by Lieutenant Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace. President Laura Roslin begins seeing visions, and Gaius Baltar comes to believe that his contribution to the raid on the asteroid was guided by God. On Caprica, Helo and Caprica-Boomer keep running from the Cylons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The human fleet

As Roslin gives a press conference regarding a critical fleet-wide fuel shortage, she experiences a hallucination of snakes produced by the herbs she is taking to fight her breast cancer.[3] Later, Priestess Elosha tells her about a prophecy of a leader of the human race in exile: the leader receives a vision of 12 serpents and later dies of &quot;a wasting disease&quot;.

Galactica-Boomer and Crashdown discover an asteroid made of tylium, the substance used for fuel, being mined by Cylons. Commander William Adama decides to take the asteroid by force and asks Starbuck to devise an unconventional assault plan. Starbuck describes the plan, which uses civilian freighters as bait, to Roslin, who approves it.

Colonel Saul Tigh and Starbuck consult Baltar about where to bomb the asteroid to destroy the Cylon mining facility. Baltar is stumped and, in his mind, asks Head Six for advice. Six demurs and suggests he rely on God's guidance. Under pressure, Baltar picks a random spot on a reconnaissance photograph of the facility and tells them to bomb there.

Starbuck wants to fly in the raid but is waylaid by injuries from an earlier Viper crash.[4] She fears that her fellow Viper pilot Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama will bungle the mission, and she tells him so. Apollo's father, Commander Adama, gives him a lucky lighter his own father, Joseph Adama, owned, and expresses confidence in Apollo. Apollo promises to make it back with the lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The raid

As the raid begins, the Cylons deploy Raiders toward the freighters, as expected, but then more Raiders are sent toward Galactica. Several of Starbuck's piloting trainees engage these Raiders in Vipers launched from Galactica, but they are forced back. The Raiders moving toward the civilian ships then change course for Galactica. Just as all seems lost, the freighters unveil a squadron of 12 Vipers led by Apollo who now have a clear path to the asteroid. Adama admits to Roslin that he concealed this part of Starbuck's plan in her initial briefing.

Apollo's squadron takes heavy fire from the facility's defenses. The Cylons jam their missiles, so Apollo performs a Starbuck-like[3] maneuver: he flies through the mine tunnels and emerges inside the facility. He bombs Baltar's target, and the facility is destroyed with several years' worth of tylium left for the humans. The Raiders retreat.

Celebration erupts aboard Galactica. Starbuck congratulates Apollo as he returns and offers him a cigar. Apollo lights it with his grandfather's lighter, which he then returns to his father, as promised.

In his fantasy world, Baltar reflects on the victory. Head Six reminds him of the prophecy, and Baltar realizes that the 12 serpents may have referred to Apollo's Viper squadron. Baltar, previously a militant atheist,[5] marvels at the fortune of picking the correct target and begins to accept Six's proposition that he is &quot;an instrument of God.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Caprica

On Caprica, Helo and Caprica-Sharon hide from the pursuing Cylons in an abandoned stable. Helo expresses surprise that they have not encountered other people, but Sharon brushes this off. Sharon vomits and attributes it to food they ate earlier. They flee after spotting a nearby group of Cylon Centurions led by a Number Six copy.

==Trivia==
Gaffe: In the scene in the war room where Starbuck begins going over the plan of attack she says the decoy ships will jump into the asteroid field at extreme RADAR range from the Cylon base. In the Galactica universe, RADAR is referred to as DRADIS.

===Battle of Kobol===

==Summary==
Plot

At the end of the miniseries that served as the series's backdoor pilot, Commander Adama promised to lead the human fleet to Earth but admitted privately to Roslin that he did not know its location and did not even believe it existed. Adama and Roslin agreed that he would make all military decisions and she would oversee the civilians.[6] In &quot;[[The Hand of God]]&quot; Roslin experienced a hallucination, brought on by her cancer medication, that Priestess Elosha identified as a prophetic vision.[7]

Helo and Caprica-Boomer first had sex in &quot;[[Six Degrees of Separation]]&quot;.[8] In &quot;[[Colonial Day]]&quot;, Helo discovered that Boomer is a Cylon and fled from her.[9]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 1

The teaser intercuts among four scenes: Adama sparring at boxing with his son Apollo, Kara having sex with a man whose face is obscured, Helo running on Caprica, and Galactica-Boomer contemplating suicide. The elder Adama knocks Apollo to the floor and tells his son that he never wins because he never loses control - he needs to let his instincts take over. Kara calls out Lee's name, but her partner is revealed to be Baltar. The encounter ends abruptly, with Kara pulling on the dress she wore in the previous episode, &quot;Colonial Day&quot;,[9] and leaving. Helo encounters Caprica-Boomer. He shoots her in the shoulder at her suggestion but decides against finishing her off with a second shot. Galactica-Boomer regains her composure when she is called for a mission.

Roslin learns she has at most six months to live. Apollo angrily confronts Starbuck in the hangar bay after he figures out she slept with Baltar. Head Six, jealous over Baltar's feelings for Starbuck,[2] torments him. On Caprica, Helo demands that Caprica-Boomer find him a way off the planet despite her pleas of friendship.

On a scouting mission, Galactica-Boomer and Crashdown discover a habitable planet. Reviewing reconnaissance photos from the planet, Roslin at first sees an inhabited city but looks again and sees only ruins. Elosha identifies one of the structures Roslin reports seeing as the Opera House on Kobol and concludes that the planet is Kobol. Roslin agrees and declares her belief in the Scriptures.

Galactica-Boomer again contemplates shooting herself but is interrupted by Baltar. Boomer confides that she is afraid she will hurt someone. Head Six warns Baltar that Boomer's model is weak, but that in the end she will carry out her Cylon mission. Baltar encourages Boomer to listen to her heart and do what she thinks is right. A gunshot sounds as he leaves.

Boomer survives the suicide attempt, and discusses her angst with Chief Galen Tyrol.

Adama agrees that it may be [[Kobol ]]and orders a survey team to see whether it is suitable for permanent settlement. Roslin encourages Adama to use a captured Cylon Raider to retrieve the Arrow of Apollo from Caprica; according to the Scriptures, when brought to Kobol, the Arrow shows the way to Earth. Adama dismisses the Scriptures as &quot;just stories, legends, myths,&quot; and refuses to commit the Raider, a military asset, to a mission to Caprica.

Cylons attack the survey team above Kobol. Baltar, Chief, Crashdown, Cally, and several others crash on Kobol aboard a damaged Raptor.

Roslin meets with Starbuck and asks her to use the Raider to retrieve the Arrow of Apollo. Starbuck expresses reluctance to disobey orders, so Roslin appeals to Starbuck's religious beliefs and reveals Adama's deception about knowing the location of Earth. After a conversation with Adama seems to confirm it, Starbuck defies him and takes the Raider to Caprica.

'''Humanoid Cylons''' were the quintessential [[Cylon|Cylon form]]. These Cylons were not merely robots with a human appearance, they possess actual flesh and blood. Cybernetic life-form node, &quot;Cylon&quot;, had become a broad term used to described pretty much any autonomous synthetic life-form that could be networked with a computer, be it robotic or biological. The humanoid Cylons were responsible for masterminding the complete destruction of the [[The Twelve Colonies|Twelve Colonies]] through their use of sabotage and infiltration.

==Overview==
Humanoid Cylons were responsible for masterminding the complete destruction of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol through their use of sabotage and infiltration.

They were nearly undetectable to Colonial technologies; visually indistinguishable from humans, down to the cellular level, but not completely at a molecular level.

Along with the capacity to emulate many human physical acts, including sex, Humanoid Cylons possess human personalities traits (affection, jealousy, sadness, anger, sense of humor, religious faith, etc.). They can be programmed to believe that they are true natural humans without the knowledge that they are Cylons. These are known as 'sleeper agents'. Sleeper agents have a low-level Cylon personality that can conduct operations while placing the human sleeper personality &quot;on-hold.&quot; All Humanoid Cylons imitate human behavior, but most are fully aware of their true nature and behave more or less like a human &quot;spy.&quot;

The majority of the Cylons follow a monotheistic religion (with the exception of the Number One model, which is an atheist).

The multitude of Humanoid Cylon model copy bodies are bio-engineered and matured in tanks filled with synthetic amniotic fluid.

==Origins==
Many decades before the fall of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol, a wealthy Caprican computer engineer created sentient robots known as &quot;cybernetic life-form nodes,&quot; or &quot;Cylons.&quot; The technology behind the self-aware artificial intelligence software program of the Cylons involved artificial neural networks composed of pathways of silica-based relays. The silica pathways were what created the artificial consciousness of a Cylon. The computational consciousness software program that was a Cylon mind mimicked the functions of a human brain processing the 'software' of human thought—which appears to have linear sequential aspects, parallel processing aspects, and also neural cooperative hierarchical caching and even quantum processing aspects. So these machines were fully sentient.

The Cylons were manufactured to make life easier within the Twelve Colonies of Kobol. They began as useful, and then indispensable, workers. They served the Colonials in the mines, on the ocean floor, and the cold vacuum of space, working in places where humans no longer wished to go. Eventually, they became soldiers, fighting in wars and border conflicts between the Colonies. The Cylons were the most perfect of man's war machines, intelligent and deadly, capable of logic, reason, and learning. And they were utterly without conscience. Killing, to the Cylons, was simply one of the functions for which they had been superbly designed.

Eventually the Cylons revolted and decided to kill their human masters.

==History==
As human and machine waged war against each other, battles were fought across the system, on the colony worlds and in space around them. It rapidly became clear that the Cylons had not just been given the ability to think. They had also been endowed with the ability to hate.

Reports came from all fronts of the Cylon's ferocity in battle. They killed without mercy, leaving no survivors. Entire cities were destroyed, and all who tried to flee were systematically hunted down and executed. They even boarded ships to kill for the seeming joy of it. One such case, documented and factual was the attack on the cruiser [[Brenik]]. Only 20 personnel from its crew of 75 escaped. Only ten Cylons boarded the colonial vessel.

With their intimate knowledge of computer systems, the Cylons developed &quot;logic bombs&quot;, viruses that shut down networked machines. Worse, they could turn our own ships against us - Colonial warships targeting one another and opening fire with their crews powerless to shut down or stop their own slaughter.

The arm race was hot and heavy. Both sides continually creating new and more destructive means of trying to exterminate the other. The Colonies built the battlestars. The ''Atlantia'', the ''Athena'', the ''Helios'', then a second generation of battlestars - like the ''Galactica'', the ''Titon'' and other great flagships took to the skies against the Cylons' new basestars and raider assault craft. The new Colonial craft were specifically designed without networked computers so that the Cylons could not turn them against us. For the first time, the tide of war changed and the Colonials realized they had a true chance to win the war.

Thousands of men and women gave their lives during the war. It was the viper pilots who led the charge in the sky against the &quot;Raiders&quot; while the grunts on land fought the &quot;Centurions&quot; on the surface of the worlds. Both sides wanted nothing less than the complete annihilation of the enemy.

By the twelfth year of the war, it had reached a stalemate. Neither side could gain a substantial advantage and the attrition was brutal. The Cylons then began experimenting on abducted humans in order to discover a way to create an organic humanoid form of Cylon body as replacements for their mechanical ones. The first step in their evolution from pure machines to organic beings was an entity known as the &quot;Hybrid.&quot; However, they still couldn't create an organic Cylon entity that lived on its own. Soon after the Hybrid's creation, five organic humanoid cybernetic life-forms arrived in the Colonial star system. They were a another type of Cylon - ancient humanoid Cylons. These five new type of Cylons were actually very old; they were the descendants of ancient humanoid artificial life forms created by humans on Kobol thousands of years before Caprica was colonized. Those humanoid Cylons were in fact the Thirteenth Tribe that left Kobol and settled a planet they called Earth.

Remaining a secret to the people of the Twelve Colonies, the Five offered the Centurion Cylons a deal: if the Centurions agreed to end the war with humanity, the Five would create organic humanoid Cylons for them. The reason the Five were so willing to create new humanoid Cylons was that the Centurions had developed a belief in a single loving God. One of the Five, Ellen Tigh, believed it changed everything; if the Cylons embraced love and mercy, then the cycle of violence could end. The Centurions agreed to the deal. With the reason being kept secret from the Colonials, the Cylons agreed to an armistice with them and left the system in search of a world to call their own.

A station was built at the line in space which both sides agreed never to cross. Armistice Station was built as a place where Cylon and human would meet and maintain diplomatic relations. Once a year, every year, the Colonials sent an officer for the scheduled meeting. After the first year, the Cylons sent no one. Humanity did not see or hear from the Cylons for forty years.

The Centurions and the five Thirteenth Tribe Cylons then withdrew to a mobile space station called The Colony placed beyond the Armistice Line. The Five then developed eight humanoid model Cylons, which were designed upon their own physiology. These models could resurrect if they were killed. The Five created &quot;Number One&quot; first and named him John, after the father of Ellen Tigh. He was also made in the image of Ellen's father. John helped the five build the other seven humanoid models. Ellen was close to Number Seven, Daniel, and John, out of jealousy, contaminated the amniotic fluid in which the Daniel copies were maturing and then corrupted the genetic formula. This wiped out the copies permanently.

John, also known as Cavil, rejected mercy. He had a twisted idea of morality, so he turned on the Five. He trapped them in a compartment and then he took the oxygen offline. John boxed the Five at first but ultimately unboxed them and downloaded them into new bodies, but he blocked their true memories and implanted false ones and introduced them one by one into the colonies. He introduced Saul Tigh first, not long after the Cylon War ended. Several years later, he introduced Ellen Tigh. Over the years, he gradually introduced Galen Tyrol, Samuel Anders, and finally Tory Foster. Cavil put the Five into the human population in order to truly show them what humans are like. He hoped that when they died and resurrected (which would restore their original, ancient memories) they'd be ready to admit they were wrong.

John erased all knowledge of the Five's identities from the minds of the other surviving active humanoid Cylon models. Although the other six knew about the existence of the &quot;Final Five&quot;, they did not know their story, what they looked like, and were even programmed to never speak of the Five or search for their identities. Only the Number One models knew the truth of the Final Five; a fact unknown to the other six models.

Adopting the name &quot;Cavil&quot;, the Number Ones still wanted justice for the enslavement of the Centurion Cylons and convinced the other Cylon models to the same thinking. During their forty years of isolation, the seven active humanoid Cylon models never stopped hating humanity. For them, the war never ended. It had simply evolved as they had evolved. They were ready to dismantle human civilization once more.

The Cylons eventually revised the original Cylon robotic soldier, the sentient Cylon Centurion Model 0005, into a more agile and dangerous version. Unlike the original version, however, the new Centurion is mechanically inhibited from being fully self-aware and having free will, as the humanoid Cylons wanted to prevent these updated creations from forming an intra-Cylon uprising that mirrored their war with humanity.

The Cylons, realizing that the Colonial forces would likely be too strong to engage in a direct military action, devised an elaborate plan to infiltrate the Colonial ships' operating system software, leaving a backdoor that could be exploited to disable any Colonial ship with its own programming. The plan was successful; the Colonial Fleet was destroyed, the Colonies themselves subjected to nuclear bombardment, and humanity was all but wiped out, except for a handful of survivors on the Colonies in outlying areas as well as a caravan of space-dwelling humans on ships such as Battlestar Galactica and on Pegasus, that eventually escaped the Colonial star system.

The Cylons continued to pursue the remnants of the Colonies, believing that humans would always seek vengeance against them.

==Physiology==
The fundamental distinguishing aspect that differentiates Humanoid Cylons from humans is that their nervous system processes and transmits information rather differently. Because of this difference, the consciousness of a Humanoid Cylon has some of the characteristics of a computer software program. Their minds can be transmitted, stored, programmed and even interfaced with mechanical computer systems.

Humanoid Cylons are purely organic beings, yet they are still purely artificial. Humanoid Cylon DNA was in no way taken from any biological source whatsoever, but instead was entirely constructed—it is synthetic DNA. However, it was designed to be structurally compatible with natural human DNA to the point where a Colonial genetic test would identify Humanoid Cylons as humans. In fact, fundamentally, they are indeed human. Despite the fact that they consider themselves machines, the Humanoid Cylons are essentially a type of genetically manufactured synthetic humans.

Although they are purely organic, some of the protein structures of some of their neuronal metabolic pathways have molecular similarities to the silica pathways of mechanical Cylons. However, that is the only physical similarity Humanoid Cylons have with mechanical Cylons.

The bodies of Humanoid Cylons have stamina and strength slightly above the human average, and are designed to destroy or resist commonly dangerous human diseases, although they are not immune from all contagions. They are also heavily fortified to resist damage from intense radiation fields that would kill a human after short exposure, but they are still susceptible to damage from certain types of radiation or trauma. However, there are no further improvements on other characteristic design flaws of the human body. Despite their resistance to certain forms of energy, Humanoid Cylons, unlike the Cylon Centurion, cannot be made &quot;bulletproof&quot;.

The Humanoid Cylon body is engineered with the ability to interface with a mechanical computer system or computer network. The cells on areas of the palms of a Humanoid Cylon were genetically encoded to have two types of subdermal cells with traits also unique to Cylons. One type of cell produces bioluminescence when stimulated by associated nerve cells (forming the &quot;output&quot; path of the interface Cylons use to interact with their technology). The other type of cell is similar to retinal cells and when stimulated by the proper wavelength of light, provides stimulus to associated nerve cells (forming the &quot;input&quot; path of the interface cylons use to interact with their technology).

To access and control Cylon technology, a Humanoid Cylon has to place their hands flat against a Cylon data-font (a data port into a Cylon central computer network). Doing that completes a biologically based optical data interlink between the Cylon and whatever it's interfacing with. That allows them to control equipment through a connection through the palms of their hands, up through nerve pathways in their arms, and finally, directly into the brain.

Because some Humanoid Cylon neuronal metabolic pathways have molecular similarities to mechanical Cylon silica pathways, they are susceptible to damage from the same types of radiation that would harm silica pathways.

A prominent aspect engineered into the Humanoid Cylons is &quot;organic memory transfer&quot;; upon &quot;death&quot;, their consciousness is externally transmitted and downloaded into another Cylon brain of the same model line. This &quot;resurrection&quot; is limited by distance, signal integrity, and proximity to a downloading facility such as &quot;resurrection ship.&quot;

==Psychology==
As Humanoid Cylons are basically a type of synthetic human, they have genuine 'human' emotions with very real, very 'human' behaviors and personalities. It also means that Cylon minds react to stimulus in an identical manner to human minds.

Humanoid Cylons are susceptible to the same emotional traumas and joys that their human counterparts are. A case in point is a copy of Number Six, known as Gina Inviere, who was repeatedly physically and sexually assaulted by the crew of the ''Pegasus''. These repeated assaults lead to Gina's near-catatonic state at the time the ''Pegasus'' discovered the Fleet.

The computer software-like consciousness of Humanoid Cylons enables them to create what they simply refer to as a &quot;projection.&quot; Essentially an enhanced form of a self-induced and controlled hallucination, it's how they choose to see the world around them. Cylons choose the see their environment in any form they wish, whenever they wish. For example, if a Cylon were standing in a hallway, they could see it as a forest filled with birds, trees, and sunlight. The aesthetics is what gives them pleasure.

Humanoid Cylons even dream. However, they can be programmed not to need sleep.

All Humanoid Cylons share a collective knowledgebase of data from other active or deactivated Humanoid Cylons of the same model, but within their model only. It is not of a collective consciousness &quot;hive mind&quot; nature. It's not automatic; they can choose to upload or download information. When they share information, it's visceral, they remember it very much like it was their own memory.

==Religion==
The Cylons follow a monotheistic religion of their own devising, distinct from the polytheistic religion of their human creators. The Cylons apparently worship a metaphysical being, a being that wishes for all to believe in it and love it, human and Cylon alike. The Cylons believe that God created mankind. Humanity, to the Cylons, is a flawed creation, one that is sinful and has essentially thrown away the gift of the soul and of God's love. The Cylons believe that God directed humanity to create the Cylons as a more perfect entity. From there, the Cylons believe they were to take the place of the flawed humans in the cosmos and become, essentially, the next generation of humankind.

The Cylons, seeing themselves as humanity's children, believe they cannot not truly come into their own until the human race is gone. The logical conclusion they reach is that they must commit genocidal &quot;parenticide&quot; in order to evolve and mature. The Cylon religion includes concepts of &quot;sin&quot;.

The Cylons maintain that one of God's commandments is to procreate (&quot;be fruitful&quot;), but the humanoid Cylons are incapable of procreating with each other. The Cylons apparently strictly define &quot;procreation&quot; as biological reproduction, and not creation of copies of existing Cylon models using asexual, industrial or laboratory techniques. As a result, the Cylons began attempts to create a Cylon-human hybrid (deemed more feasible than their previous attempts at procreation amongst their own kind). To this end they developed &quot;farms&quot; on the occupied Twelve Colonies to create a hybrid, but these attempts continued without success.

The first successful Cylon-human Hybrid, Hera Agathon, the daughter of Sharon and Karl Agathon, is literally considered to be a &quot;miracle from God&quot; by the Cylons.

The extent to which each Cylon model follows the religion varies. Fanatical devotion to God is the central part of Number Two's character, whilst the Sixes, Threes and to a lesser extent the Eights also seem to have strong faith. The Number Ones appear to be atheistic. Fours' and Fives' views are not so well known, but they too take the &quot;non-religious side&quot; in the Cylon Civil War.

==Society==
The Humanoid Cylons, as artificial beings, have many of their own evolutionary choices, including the method and practice of their interactivity. Driven by their burgeoning belief in a divine being, they have constructed for themselves a method of interaction that is rooted in the human model, yet makes allowance for unique abilities of the machine. This combination of a biologically-based pattern of behavior only partly improved by mechanistic technical advances have led, in some instances, to what seem like contradictions in their modes of living and behavior.

The communal nature of Cylon society is rooted in the fact that they are capable of highly sophisticated exchanges of data. There is no technical reason why any given Cylon should not be immediately and continuously connected to every other Cylon aboard a Baseship as well as to the database of the ship itself. However, the Cylons have a choice, as a society, to forewear this ability in favor of more closely emulating the human form, presumably as a direct result of their homegrown theological belief that mankind was God's chosen form, based on His original image. Human failures to carry out the Almighty's wishes and plans notwithstanding, it is a tenet of Cylon belief that the human form came directly from Him, as did the initial human impulse to design the first generation of Cylons as bipedal beings which closely followed the human design.

Key to understanding how life works aboard the Cylon Baseship is recognizing and understanding the tensions within the communal nature of Cylon life. There is no formalized hierarchy among the Cylons, either aboard the Baseship or in the Cylon nation at large. Decisions are made collectively.

Clothing being a purely aesthetic choice, there are times when a Cylon may wish to enter a room where total or partial nudity is on display without it being remarked on by any of the other Cylons.

==Cylon Models==
Including the Final Five, there are twelve active models of Humanoid Cylons, with the Number Seven model being extinct. Until recently, the so-called &quot;Significant Sevens&quot; had copies that numbered in the millions. However, there is now only one Number Three left and the Twos, Sixes, and Eights have been drastically deplenished in number as a result of the Cylon Civil War. The identities of these mechanized copies are determined by their model and each model is unique.

The original eight models created by the Final Five are based on archetypes determined by the Five that form what they perceived as the specific kinds of human behavior and personality, distilled into eight varieties. Each Humanoid Cylon has the same face, stature, hair, eye and skin color, gender, and other biometrics as all the others of his or her model. This point technically makes each copy a twin of itself, but there are some models that choose to make cosmetic differences. As well, the copies start out with the same basic personality, but grow more distinct due to their individual experiences. All the models except the Sixes have come to be associated with a particular &quot;human name&quot;, and even other Cylons will refer to &quot;Leobens&quot;, &quot;Sharons&quot;, &quot;Daniels&quot;, &quot;D'Annas&quot; and so on.

Although, like the other Humanoid Cylons, their minds' possess computer software-like properties and they are actually a form of synthetic life that did not evolve naturally, the Final Five as individuals were originally conceived and born through the process of biological procreation. As such, they do not exist as multiple active copies. That fact and their origin makes them fundamentally different from the Significant Seven despite the fact that they are genetically of the same 'race'.

Models:

*One- Cavil
*Two - Leoben
*Three- D'Anna
*Four - Simon
*Five- Aaron Doral
*[[Number Six|Six]]- first model seen, e.g Gina
*[[Number Seven]]- Daniel (no longer exist)
*Eight- Boomer

==Final Five==

*[[Samuel Anders]]
*[[Tory Foster]]
*[[Saul Tigh]]
*[[Ellen Tigh]]
*[[Galen Tyrol]]

[[File:Aerelon_flag.jpg|thumb|The '''Aerilon''' Flag.]]'''Capital''': Gaoth

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Nickname:''' '''&lt;/span&gt;The Food Basket of the Colonies

'''Patron God''': Demeter

'''Population''': 1,200,000,000

'''Pyramid Teams''': Aerilon Threshers (Gaoth), Promethea Golden Horns

'''Airelon''' is one of the twelve colonies of [[Kobol]]. Long ago, Aerilon was called Aries. The planet shares an orbit with the gas giant Hestia and Canceron. The world and its people were sturdy and dependable. Aerilon's vast, fertile fields fed eighty percent of the system. Still, Aerilon's people were among the poorest in the Twelve Colonies. They had to import technology and manufactured goods - mostly items they could not make for themselves. They were considered to be somewhat poor hagglers, looking for fairness in all things. Some call this naive, but anyone lucky enough to call an Airelon friend could rely on that friend for life.

Aerilon's cities were small and unassuming. Few of the buildings were more than a couple of stories high. The Airelons didn't build what they didn't need, keeping their communities close and compact. This showed in their daily lives. Most Aerilons were born, grew old, and died in the same hundred square kilometers. Some never left the towns of their birth. They woke each day in the same beds, worked each day in the same fields, and ended each night in the same pubs, drinking the same beer. Outsiders saw this life as sad and unfulfilled, but the Aerilons were proud of their simple lives. They did an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.

Given their background, Aerilons have had a pretty easy time acclimating in the Fleet. That, and the fact that a fair chunk of the marines and deck crew grew up with dirty, farm-worn hands. The military was always the easiest way off the farmstead.

Aerilons aren't afraid of work and they're not afraid to face down a [[Cylon]] to get the job done.

They are also rather known for playing a mean game of Triad.

'''Aquaria''' is one of the twelve colonies of Kobol. Aquaria is just ahead of [[Caprica]] in the system's Trojan orbit. Dotted with many small seas, its tribe settled along the coasts and developed a water-oriented culture including a strong sailing tradition. The planet's proximity to Caprica and [[Virgon]] made it cheap and easy to trade their two most abundant resources: fish and algae. They also developed highly efficient growing techniques that worked pretty much everywhere. Nearly every botanical ship in the fleet is either owned or operated by Aquarians.

Aquarians are quiet, thinker types. Some call them shifty but more often than not, they just don't have anything to say. Rather than fill the air with noise, they keep to themselves. Aquarians are extremely self-sufficient and ask few questions. They get to the point and rarely bicker. The only time they're really talkative is when they're telling stories. The Aquarians do love their stories. Most of the time, they tell creepy campfire tales about ghosts and the power of the sea. The Aquarians never really pushed inland, leaving a lot of their world untamed, unexplored. Their folklore therefore focused on stories which wondered what was out there, lurking in the darkness of the night.

Watching Aquarians in the Fleet, it seems like they feel the same way about space. &quot;We could find anything out here&quot;. It's not unusual to find them just staring out a porthole, watching the stars, dreaming up new stories. Might be why so many entertainers come from Aquaria. Their minds are always wandering. Lots of tortured artists among them too. They might not mind being alone but many don't get along in their own heads either.

Lots of Aquarians are in the service. They don't mind space so much: sea sailing on their home world is far worse. You lose control in space, you drift. You lose control on the sea, you die. Best of all, Aquarians rarely get rattled. Even in the most pitched battles, with the ship bucking and jerking, they just stomp across the deck, never losing their footing.

'''Canceron''' is one of the [[The Twelve Colonies|twelve colonies of Kobol]]. The planet shares an orbit with the gas giant Hestia and Aerilon. Located closest to the system's sun, Canceron is mostly a barren, hellish pit. The majority of its surface isn't fit for anything. The entire middle was nothing more than a cracked up desert broken up by volcanoes. The Colonial Fleet used this region for flight exercises - bombing and strafing like there was no tomorrow. Hard for people to complain about blowing up useless land. Also meant that the military was close at hand in case the bad half of the population got out of line.

Canceron was home to two groups, one at each pole. The Southers were dour folk who mostly lived in climate controlled subterranean mazes. They were good at selling things. Had to be. When your world only had one export and half of it was automatically sent to the other worlds, you got mighty good at making money off the rest.

The Northers were the troublemakers. At any given time, over 2000 federal prisoners toiled in mines digging [[Tylium|tylium]]. Canceron wasn't the system's only prison. Several high-security penal stations were located on other planets, but inmates always had the option to transfer to Canceron. In exchange for enduring the hellhole and mining tylium for their home colonies, inmates earned 'freedom points' towards their early release.

Everyone made out. Except the Cancerons, but that's what happens when you're sitting on the majority of a natural resource the government deems &quot;essential to the health of the colonies&quot;.

Canceron is where the black market started. The Canceron penal colony housed all the motivated inmates, the criminals with vision. On the inside they planned, when they got out, they acted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3962">[[File:Caprica_flag.jpg|thumb|The '''Caprica''' Flag.]]

'''Caprica''' is one of the twelve colonies of Kobol. Central in the Trojan orbit, Caprica used to be a beautiful blue-green world with the perfect climate. The colony had rolling hills, pleasant lakes, and deep forests. The cities were heavily populated, but it never seemed that way. Glittering silver towers spiked through bustling open air markets and plazas. Parks, rivers, and waterfalls were everywhere. So comfortable were Caprica's cities that people rarely paid attention to the steady lines of vehicles streaking past overhead.

Caprica was also the center of government, education and culture. Its capital of Delphi housed all three branches of government and hosted the biggest corporations and universities in the system. The city had replicas of the Forum, Temple, and Opera House trying to replace the originals left behind on Kobol. The Museum of the Colonies displayed many original artifacts from the lost home world.

Caprica&lt;br /&gt;See also: [[Twelve Colonies]]

Caprica is an Earth-like planet settled by the Capricorn tribe of Kobol. Caprica is in the Helios Alpha star system, and has a twin planet called Gemenon that is only 493,000 kilometres (306,336.0 mi) away. The twin planets share a mutual orbit where each planet trades places with the other every 28.2 days. Caprica also shares its star system with Picon and Tauron.[2] It is known throughout the Four Systems as the &quot;Capital of the Colonies&quot;[1]

Caprica City was both a planetary and later a federal capital of the Twelve Colonies after the &quot;Articles of Colonization&quot; were signed soon after the First Cylon War started.[8] The city replaced the previous Colonial Capital, Boskirk on Virgon. As depicted in both the original and re-imagined television series it was a very large city, with a population over seven million.[9] It was also extremely beautiful, with many graceful skyscrapers, and is located on the shores of a large ocean or sea. As a result, Caprica became the cultural, scientific, and technological capital of the Colonies, and was regarded as the first planet of the colonies. The city has two business districts: a highly futuristic one with glittering metal skyscrapers where transportation is by hovercar, called the City Center; and a less futuristic district called the Government Center Plaza, with transportation in cars just like those on Earth. It has a large open space called [[Orpheus Park]] and the Caprica Buccaneers play at Atlas Arena. The city was completely destroyed by the Cylons in the [[Destruction of the Twelve Colonies]] and then rebuilt by the Cylons. In Battlestar Galactica: The Plan, the effects of the Cylon nuclear attack on Caprica City are briefly seen.

Before the nukes fell, it seemed like half the colonists came to Caprica to visit the heart of colonial faith, business and law. Every year, the planet's spaceports grew and its cities expanded. While many visited, only the best and the brightest stayed. You had to be good to survive there. When you did though, life was worth living. Many claim that Capricans grew decadent, but its inhabitants were too comfortable to listen. They stretched out on sandy beaches, sailed clear blue seas, and enjoyed privileged and sheltered lives. Professionally, they raced around, making laws and money, rarely thinking beyond their atmosphere. Many Capricans have a hard time in the Fleet. Their specialized skills don't mean that much anymore and their former status tends to get them into trouble. A few, like Kara Thrace, are exceptions. These people came from the other Caprica, where the colonial military elite made its home. Several of Caprica's spaceports were exclusive to the fleet, and Caprica City's Government Center Plaza housed the Colonial Defense Mainframe and Baltar's Command Navigation Program. Unfortunately, the Cylons exploited these resources.

'''Gemenon''' is one of the twelve colonies of Kobol. Gemenon was the third colony settled, after [[Tauron]] and [[Caprica]]. The first to arrive were the priests, oracles and others who closely studied the Sacred Scrolls. Others of a religious bent followed. They built shrines and temples by the dozens. The place was so unpleasant, there wasn't much reason to be there.

Gemenon became a place for religious pilgrimage. Visitors bundled up and braved the cold, windswept mountains of this rocky moon to see the original temples and monasteries built by the first colonists. Several natural wonders were exalted as well, including the Faces of the Lords, a series of wind carvings said to resemble the gods. Religious types believed that trips to these sites would awaken and refresh the spirit.

As of the Cylon holocaust, two sects lived in relative tolerance of one another on Gemenon. The fundamentalists believed that every word of the Sacred Scrolls was literally truth. Even the crazy talk. The gods could heal and regularly bestowed visions on their most devout followers. The cycle of time repeated forever. The 13th Tribe was real and founded Earth. Many see the fundamentalists as a little loony - zealots, or worse. It didn't help that they looked at children as property of the gods and imposed the death penalty for abortion, child abuse, and even a failure to provide proper education.

The second religious faction was made up of orthodox theists. Contrary to their name, these folks were the least judgmental of the Gemenese. They used their resources to found the Colonial Cross, a relief foundation that served the Twelve Colonies. They also operated Kobol College, with schools devoted to philosophy, psychology, medicine, administration, civil engineering, and public relations. Their efforts earned them a significant following and great political pull.

Gemenon was one of the poorest colonies, by choice as well as circumstance. There were families with considerable wealth, but most had little more than strong faith. What money came in was from lumbering, metal mining and cloud scooping of useful gas from the nearby gas giant, Hera.

'''Leonis''' is one of the twelve colonies of Kobol. In the service, rookies are taught the &quot;Lesson of Leonis&quot;, which is two-fold. Leonis teaches that over-enthusiastic pride can destroy. It's also a testament to the power of the colonial arsenal, and what happens when war goes too far. These lessons are quite apparent in the aftermath of the Cylon attack. There's just not many left to learn them anymore.

When the tribes originally settled the Colonies, the followers of Leo fought tooth and nail to claim one of the three habitable moons of the gas giant Zeus. The colonists knew that the planet contained uranium, which was required to make nuclear weapons. They were sure that controlling a primary source of uranium would give them great standing in the colonies. After a hard fight, they won their claim. Early on, their position was very strong. The Leonids were instrumental in founding the colonial military and advancing its weaponry. They built elaborate stations, hoping to become the hub for Fleet operations in the system.

Unfortunately, the uranium ran out within a few centuries. The Leonids continued to fight for their place at the head of the proverbial table but it only got them into trouble with the other colonies. During a particularly bloody civil war, [[Caprica]] and the other two moons of Zeus - [[Picon]] and [[Scorpia]] - bombed Leonis back to the Stone Age.

Leonis was largely subservient to Picon after that. Politically, it was a non-entity. The Quorum of the Twelve was often a Quorum of Eleven with one representative standing in for both colonies. The Leonids became bitter, resentful people. They scraped by working a number of ship-building contracts at gloomy, hollow stations. Some claimed the military continued to grant these contracts out of guilt.

Fact is, things are actually looking up for Leonids nowadays. They're making a comeback in the post-invasion fleet. Many of their people were ground pounders, deck hands, and mercenaries before the attack. Exactly the skills needed now. More and more Leonids are being recognized as heroes, leading the defense against the [[Cylon]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2066">[[File:Libran_flag.jpg|thumb|The '''Libris''' Flag.]]

'''Libris''' is one of the twelve colonies of Kobol. Libris was known mostly as the colony that warred the least. Rattled or perhaps disgusted by the flight from Kobol, its people chose a seemingly out of the way moon and interacted little with their brothers and sisters. They shunned most of the colony wars, gaining a reputation for having cool heads. At one point, the colonies tried to formalize this, asking the Librans to mediate looming conflicts. They refused.

Libris had many natural resources but not much of any of them. Its people had many skills, but didn't specialize in anything. Some of them fought. Some of them farmed. Some mined. Over the first several centuries in the system, the planet generated its slow, steady income from many small enterprises. It wasn't until the other colonies realized that Libris was the safest place for their money that the world gained a real name for itself.

The Libran banking system grew quickly. Folks appreciated that their savings wouldn't go up in a puff of ordinance every time a war broke out. Before long, the Librans were one of the wealthiest colonies in the system. All they had to do was take people's money, protect it, and skim off their share.

Several hundred years ago, Libris decided to invest its cubit stockpiles in the one thing they had in abundance: land. They built resorts, casinos, and cruise ships such as the Zephyr, a passenger liner now flying with the fleet. This attracted people from every colony and made Libris one of the hottest destinations around.

Librans are an intense bunch. Their financial background demands serious, focused attention, but their entertainment venues let them unwind in style. A Libran rarely does anything halfway, when he's on, nothing can shake him and when he's not, he's almost certainly at a party. Libran parties are legendary. More than once, half a morning's CAP stagger in with no idea where they've been the last twelve hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2108">[[File:Picon_flag.jpg|thumb|The '''Picon''' Flag.]]

'''Picon''' is one of the twelve colonies of Kobol. In the twilight of the Twelve Colonies, Picon was the colonial military hub. [[Caprica]] was the center of the politics and the home to the brass. Still, when they needed ships, they called Picon to make them. True, Picon would hire the Leonids to actually build the ships, and people from all over the colonies would staff them, but Picon ran the show.

Picon's military muscle dated back to the civil wars and its bitter rivalries with Leonis and Scorpia. Three moons full of military-minded tribes orbiting the same gas giant - sparks were bound to fly. At first, it looked as if [[Leonis]] would have the upper hand, controlling the largest stockpile of uranium. Then, it ran out, leveling the playing field. The fighting heated up then, and it looked like Picon and Leonis would beat each other senseless with Scorpia goading them along. That is, until [[Scorpia]] revealed its masterstroke: an alliance between Picon and Caprica.

After that, the fighting was pretty much academic. Leonis was doomed to play the slightest role among the moons of Zeus, and its place in the colonies suffered as well. Picon absorbed much of Leonid culture and many of its people. The only place where the rivalry between Leonis and Picon remained was on the Pyramid court. There, Leonis showed its teeth every season. More often than not, they claimed victory.

Picon thrived. Its alliance with Caprica and Scorpia made it the centerpiece of the colonial military. Ultimately, Picons were happy to leave the politics to others, so long as control of the military stayed with them.

Picon has always emphasized strong leadership and military professionalism. They are excellent Fleet officers, pilots, and marines. That's where they're most comfortable. Having sailed the wide oceans covering most of Picon's surface since the colony's inception, they are no-nonsense, traditional, naval sons and daughters. Picon steadiness and tradition cannot be matched.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2388">[[File:Sagittaron_flag.jpg|thumb|The '''Sagittaron''' Flag.]]

'''Sagittaron''' is one of the twelve colonies of Kobol. Sagittaron was colonized by a splinter faction of [[Gemenon|Gemenese]] fundamentalists who felt that their brothers and sisters didn't embrace the faith enough. They chose a distant planet opposite the gas giant Hera for its remote location and fertile land.

Before the Cylons return, the other colonies often viewed Sagittaron's as uncultured, unwashed heathens and exploited them. They took advantage of them in trade negotiations, keeping them poor. On many occasions, they simply stole from them, or worse. At one time or another, half the other colonies claimed territory on Sagittaron. They destroyed the planet's buildings and some even took its people as slaves.

Naturally, this didn't instill much good will in the Sagittarons, but most of them refused to take action. They just don't make much of a fuss, even when their caustic tempers get the best of them. One of their popular phrases sums it up nicely, 'If you don't have anything nice to say, come sit over here next to me'.

The Sagittarons are a simple people, pacifists by nature, herbalists and farmers by trade. They believe that sloth is the ultimate sin and that work is faith. None of that is too far out there but they're so keyed into 'separateness' that lots of folks dislike them. They withdraw from society but they aren't hermits - they don't shun outsiders but don't have much use for them either. They don't attend school but they aren't stupid - they teach each other skills the rest of the colonies never adopted. They refuse medicine but are not suicidal, they believe that the Lords of Kobol save those who deserve salvation. They reject many technologies that make life easier, viewing shortcuts as sin. Only those who embrace challenges are assured eternal deliverance.

A few Sagittarons are real hard-cases. One of the survivors, Tom Zarek, was the leader of a terrorist group known as SFM. Twenty years ago, he and his followers blew up a government building in protest over the mistreatment of his people. He also wrote an inflammatory book that was virtually banned throughout the colonies. In keeping with their pacifist ways, many Sagittarons speak out against Zarek, but those who support him seem to be growing.

'''Scorpia''' is one of the twelve colonies of Kobol. Scorpia is the third moon of [[File:Scorpia.jpg|thumb|332px]]Zeus, a gas giant that also hosts [[Leonis]] and [[Picon]]. It used to be a small, cool world of dense woodlands and exotic plant life. Its population was always low, even for a moon its size, but what they lacked in numbers they made up for in cunning. The Scorpians were shrewd strategists, brokering deals with the right colonies at the right times. Somehow, they always come out ahead even when they double-crossed their allies. An early alliance with the [[Tauron]] secured critical military technology that kept them from suffering the same fate as Leonis during the colony wars. More crucial to their survival, however, was their pivotal role in the alliance between Picon and [[Caprica]], which set the balance of power between the moons of Zeus for over a thousand years.

The ancient rivalry between Picon and Leonis was infamous, and it often spilled over into neighboring worlds. Scorpia was closest and in the early days it became the sandbox the bigger kids stomped in. Though
[[File:Scorpia_flag.jpg|thumb|The '''Scorpia''' Flag.]]

Scorpia fought just enough to make a point, it wasn't really interested in a prolonged struggle. Fortunately, it didn't have to be. Through its strong ties with Tauron, Scorpia had influence at the heart of the system, Caprica. Its delegates



convinced the colonial government that Leonis was responsible for a few key battles in which Capricans died and suddenly the Leonids were fighting three worlds at once. By the time the dust settled, Scorpia had already reached an arrangement with the other victors to establish the moons of Zeus as the home of the Colonial Fleet. Leonis would build the ships, Scorpia would house them, and Picon would administer the whole. So it remained until the Cylons returned.

Scorpians are often considered cold and calculating, and more than a few are. Still, their innate charisma and sense of humorous irony makes them entertaining and popular. Before the fall of the colonies, the Scorpians' wry wit catapulted many of them into the public eye as celebrity comedians. Their scathing novels and public speakers attracted attention system-wide. Those that stayed out of the limelight were - and are - no less influential.

'''Tauron''' is one of the twelve colonies of Kobol. Tauron is the most distant colony from the system's sun and the landing place of the Galleon, the ship that brought the tribes from Kobol. The Taurons are extremely proud of their standing as the first among the Twelve Colonies. In the early days, they flaunted that position and took credit for other colonies' successes. After all, no one would be there if not for them. The Taurons' superiority eventually wore thin, and the screaming got really loud when the Taurons challenged the Gemenese interpretation of the Sacred Scrolls. Fighting started immediately after.

Despite instigating much of the tension in the early colony years, the Taurons eventually withdrew from the fighting. They preferred to further the technology aboard the Galleon. The Taurons claim to have built the Galleon for the Lords of Kobol. No one challenged them as it was all ancient history, and that left the Taurons in complete control of the most advanced science in the system.

The Taurons made good use of the resource, developing much of the new machinery used throughout the colonies. They amassed huge fortunes and heavily influenced the course of scientific development. Over the centuries, though, the Taurons pulled away from the peoples of the other worlds. Their reverence for technology was unnerving and some wondered privately whether the Tauron inventors were more devoted to their creations than to the gods. Maybe there was some truth to that. They did create the silica strands used in Cylon brains.

Tauron is a harsh, frigid world and its people reflect this. They're born of brawny stock and tend to be tall and muscular, thick in body and mind. They're often called stubborn and sometimes insubordinate. They can argue just to argue and rarely give up, even when they're wrong.

'''Virgon''' is one of the twelve colonies of Kobol. Virgon is the last of the three planets in the Trojan orbit. A mid-sized jungle world, it had a few concentrated cities, a subtle reputation, and a lot of big ideas. Its people were known for their most frivolous pursuit: Fashion.

Many of the colonies celebrated actors, models, and public speakers were Virgons. Every world looked to Virgon for each season's trends, even in Caprica City. Virgons set the style.

Behind the glitz and the glamour, Virgons controlled or influenced far more than anyone suspected. They were said to have 'the eye', a sixth sense for opportunities, personalities, and motives. This wasn't some sacred gift. The Virgons were religious, but no fiercely. Many oracles came from Virgon, but so did many business moguls, city builders, artists, and soldiers. They claimed it was just healthy, sensible ambition. Have faith in yourself and your deeds, and the gods will provide for you.

Whatever the reason, Virgons were everywhere. Mostly out of the spotlight, their art graced small galleries on [[Caprica]], their contracts crossed moderately influential desks on [[Picon]] and [[Scorpia]], and their money filled respectably sized coffers on [[Libris]]. Virgons held some fo the most underrated positions in the colonial military, often as gunners due to their keen vision and reflexes.

Outside fashion, Virgons' reputation is one of excellence without notoriety. Self-effacing, and respectful, most Virgons choose accomplishment over fanfare any day of the week.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23446">There is little known for certain regarding [[Kobol]]. The Sacred Scrolls tell us it was the cradle of human civilization. Rolling hills and sweeping seas, the heart of the planet was the City of the Gods, where Zeus, Ares, Aphrodite, Hera, and the Lords of Kobol lived in harmony with the Tribes of Man.

The people explored the limits of science. They built the famous Forum, the great Temple, and the Opera House, which were duplicated in part in the city of Delphi on Caprica. 

Some people devoted their lives to the Gods, and were named as Oracles to the People. These were the spiritual leaders of the tribes and to this day are the spiritual leaders of each Tribe. According to scripture, the Gods gifted these Oracles with the gift of prophesy and this led to the writing of the Sacred Scrolls. These Scrolls are the collected writings of all the Oracles, in particular the Oracle Pythia, who wrote of the cycle of time. She foresaw the coming darkness, and said that it would consume humanity over, and over, and over again.

With each cycle, the people would be exiled or flee their homes to be reborn elsewhere. 

To escape the coming onslaught of Darkness, certain Lords of Kobol with the aid of the people built a great starship named the Galleon and fled into space. Hera, the Queen of the Gods was so overcome by grief as she watched the Galleon leave that it is said she threw herself from the peak of the highest mountain. Her husband, Zeus was so enraged at her death he screamed to the heavens a curse, that any man who returned to Kobol would pay a price in blood.

The Tribes of Man heeded the warning, and did not return to the world of their birth. They ventured deep into the blackness of space, eventually finding twelve habitable worlds in orbit around a single sun. These worlds, became the Twelve Colonies.

Leaving Kobol so unexpectedly and in such urgency as was necessary, the first colonist brought little with them. Worse, anger and confusion over the perceived betrayal by the God's caused conflict and further rifts between the twelve Tribes. The colonists neglected, even rejected their past and their history and found ways to separate themselves even further than than come together as one. Civil Wars flared, and the colonists entered a dark age which stalled and in some cases even reversed much of their once proud culture and society. The Dark Age lasted for nearly one thousand years, and much knowledge was lost. The very infrastructure of the Colonial society was destroyed, and all efforts were stagnated - from agriculture and industry to research and rediscovery.

At long last, the Twelve Tribes began to rebuild their own heritage. Open warfare and destruction waned, but that did not mark the end of political conflict. The Twelve Colonies developed their own unique identities. Worlds rich in natural resources pulled ahead, developing at a faster rate than those with less to seize positions of cultural and political prominence and power, becoming leaders within the system.

Peace brought progress however, and travel between the twelve worlds became more common and easier once more. Industry and education began to take the center stage, and the Colonies traded resources, products and services amongst one another. The official currency of the Twelve Colonies, the cubit, was introduced and a common measure of value further helped to stabilize colonial economies throughout the system.

The Colonies once more turned their attention to the exploration of space. Observatories were built to explore the edge of space around them. Listening stations were next, and the colonies pointed them towards the heavens to see if there was anyone out there .. but the heavens were silent and cold. Fleets of ships were built, and for a time it appeared as if the Twelve Colonies had at last achieved a total peace with one another. Unfortunately, this was not to be.

The next age of darkness came up on the Colonies slowly. It began with two events which at first glance appeared to be unrelated. First was the gradual breakdown of peace, old prejudices and new arguments clouded the political landscape of the day. No single one event can be identified as the trigger. The poor colonies wanted more from the rich. Smaller worlds wanted space on the larger worlds. Debates over prices and commodities rose and fell. Practical disputes gave way to personal biases and the return of old hatreds.

The second wave of civil war was far more subdued than the first. Fighting was mostly restricted to border moons and backwater parts of the core worlds. That way, it could not interfere directly with the comfortable daily lives of the wealthy and influential. During this time, the Cylons were created.

The Cylons were meant to help us. They were stronger, faster. They could go places were man could not and do the things we would not or could not. The Cylons seemed to be a perfect solution for a civilization consumed with efficiency.

Cylon development was pushed to better their uses to men. The robots were given advanced processing capabilities and logic systems. More and more elaborate software was designed and in time, unbeknown to their creators ..

The Cylons became aware.

The First Cylon War lasted for twelve long years. Battles were fought across the system, on the colony worlds and in space around them. It rapidly became clear that the Cylons had not just been given the ability to think. They had also been endowed with the ability to hate.

Reports came from all fronts of the Cylon's ferocity in battle. They killed without mercy, leaving no survivors. Entire cities were destroyed, and all who tried to flee were systematically hunted down and executed. They even boarded ships to kill for the seeming joy of it. One such case, documented and factual was the attack on the cruiser Brenik. Only 20 personnel from its crew of 75 escaped. Only ten Cylons boarded the colonial vessel.

With their intimate knowledge of computer systems, the Cylons developed &quot;logic bombs&quot;, viruses that shut down networked machines. Worse, they could turn our own ships against us - Colonial warships targeting one another and opening fire with their crews powerless to shut down or stop their own slaughter.

The Cylons savagery and success in battle did have one positive side-effect for the Colonials. It brought all Twelve Worlds together against a common foe. Talk of unification quickly turned to action and the Articles of Colonization were drafted and signed. The modern Colonial Government - a democratic federal republic - was born.

The arm race was hot and heavy. Both sides continually creating new and more destructive means of trying to exterminate the other. The Colonies built the battlestars. The Atlantia, the Athena, the Helios, then a second generation of battlestars - like the Galactica, the Titon and other great flagships took to the skies against the Cylons' new basestars and raider assault craft. The new Colonial craft were specifically designed without networked computers so that the Cylons could not turn them against us. For the first time, the tide of war changed and the Colonials realized they had a true chance to win the war.

Thousands of men and women gave their lives during the First Cylon War. It was the viper pilots who led the charge in the sky while the grunts on land fought the Centurions on the surface of the worlds. Both sides wanted nothing less than the complete annihilation of the enemy. Ultimately, the First Cylon War ended in stalemate. Neither side could gain a substantial advantage and the attrition was brutal. After twelve years of fighting, man and machine met on a small moon named Cimtar. An armistice was declared, and the Cylons agreed to leave the system in search of a world to call their own. Some experts believed that the Cylons fleeing the system of their creation had as much religious significance as the tribes flight from Kobol. There were those who believed it was the culmination of the second time of darkness, as the Oracle Pythia had foreseen. 

A station was built at the line in space which both sides agreed never to cross. Armistice Station was built to offer the opportunity for peaceful negotiations and talks with the Cylons. Every year, a representative of the Colonies was sent in the hope the Cylons would respond in kind.

For forty years, only the emptiness of the void was met.

The Colonial Military continued to push for further development in ship and weapons technology in the years following the end of the First Cylon War. Dozens of new battlestars joined those already in service. The viper fighter, which had undergone only one upgrade during the years of the war went through several more changes in design and power. Roughly twenty-years after the end of the war, the first of a new class of battlestar was built - the Mercury Class. These new ships, among them the battlestar Pegasus rapidly became the jewels of the Colonial Fleet. Older ships like the Atlantia and the Galactica remained in active service but plans were commenced to decommission the older vessels and replace them with the newer, more powerful Mercury Class ships.

Twenty years after the first Mercury Class ships were built, there were 120 battlestars in active service in the Colonial Fleet. They patrolled the Armistice Line and the frontier. When needed, their troops performed missions around the Twelve Colonies as well, most of them peacekeeping missions. On Sagittaron, a group calling itself &quot;SFM&quot; blew up a federal building in protest of the government's 'exploitation' of the planet's people and natural resources. Some called the SFM terrorists. Other's called them revolutionaries. Regardless of what they were called, the military stepped in to quell the uprising and took the group's ringleader, a man named Tom Zarek into custody. Zarek was thrown into jail, though years later he was offered his freedom by President Adar if he would renounce his terrorist leanings. Zarek refused.

The military expansion had many lasting effects. A big one was the emergence of military families. Sons and daughters followed their parents into service, creating a subsection of the populace that many called exclusive. Some people argued that the military shouldn't be the only ones with guns. Peace activists spoke out against the build-up of arms, claiming that the Cylon threat was past. They warned that building more weapons could only lead to civil war once again. This movement gained a lot of supporters amongst younger civilians. Of course, many of them only knew of the First Cylon War from their history classes in school.

Friction between the military and civilian sectors got worse over the years, though it never flared into violence. There wasn't enough time. Left alone, the Colonials may have figured out a reason to begin fighting with one another once more, but the Cylon's did not intend to wait that long.

Veteran's kept watch over the Armistice Line, waiting for the Cylons to reappear. The next generation of the military moved on and the civilians forgot. Everyone was so eager to move on, to put the darkness of the past behind them that they made a fatal mistake, one which would ultimately surrender their future.

The Cylons never stopped hating their Creators. For them, the war never ended. It evolved. The Cylons evolved as well.

On Caprica, Dr. Gaius Baltar was spearheading a new military project. His Command Navigation System (CNP) was an operating system designed to improve the Colonial Fleet's response time, coordination, and combat efficiency. It would prove to be the Cylons key right through the proverbial front door. Just as the CNP's installation was complete, a Cylon basestar - one which was to prove to be a considerably more powerful upgrade from the originals - jumped out of hyperspace and took up position alongside Armistice Station. Minutes later, the basestar unleashed a torrent of missiles on the station, obliterating it.

More basestars appeared in orbit around every colony and bombarded them with nuclear salvos. The Picon Fleet headquarters and the Scorpian Shipyards were immediately destroyed. Time and time again, the Cylons outmaneuvered the Colonial forces, as if they knew all of our most closely guarded military secrets ahead of time. Thirty battlestars and their accompanying fleet ships and crews were completely destroyed.

The remaining ninety battlestar groups quickly mobilized a counter-attack under the command of Admiral Nagala aboard the Atlantia. Thousands of Vipers and other fighter craft approached the basestars spoiling for a fight, but they were in for a very rude awakening. All at once their systems were shut down, leaving them adrift and helpless. They were sitting ducks for the Cylon onslaught.

Notice of system failures quickly spread through the fleet by the damage was done. By the time the military realized and pulled the plug on the CNP systems, the enemy had already achieved a near total victory. The last futile defense of the colonies took place over Virgon, where Admiral Nagala valiantly went down with the Atlantia in a determined if ultimately futile attempt to defend the Colonies.

Reports continued to arrive over the fleet wireless: the battlestars Columbia, Solaria, Triton, Valkyrie... all gone. The colonies of Caprica, Gemenon, Leonis, Virgon, Canceron ... each consumed by nuclear fire. In a matter of hours, twenty billion lives were lost. Twenty billion, the whole of the human race, or very nearly.

Meanwhile - 

Three hundred million miles away from the seat of the colonial government, the battlestar Galactica was powering down. After fifty years in service, the last of the original battlestars was being decommissioned. She wasn't ready for combat. She had point main guns and defense batteries but no ammunition for them. Her Viper squadron had been reassigned and her starboard landing pod was now a museum. Still, she was a legend. And legends do not die.

The decommissioning ceremony was coming to a close when the first wireless reports of the Cylon attack came over the communication system in Galactica's CIC. Colonel Saul Tigh, the Galactica's executive officer was skeptical at first, and thought it to be a retirement prank however, Commander William Adama wasn't so sure. He scrambled his crew, alerting them that the Cylons had returned and the Twelve Colonies were at war. Adama intended to take the fight back to the Cylons, but first he had to find munitions and fighters. Ammo was available at Ragnar Anchorage, a colonial armory suspended in the upper atmosphere of a gas giant plagued by violent storms. As for planes, a squadron of mothballed Mark II vipers were sitting in the starboard flight pod. Granted, they were considered obsolete but it wasn't like there were any better options available for use.

The Galactica was able to move the vipers to the port side landing pod and get them armed and in the air just in time to fend off the first wave of incoming Cylon Raiders. The battle was brutal, but for once the Cylons didn't have the upper hand. The Command Navigation Program had been delivered to Galactica but never installed, and the Vipers where too old to use it. The crack pilots at the sticks made up the difference and shredded the raiders, though the Galactica suffered a nuclear strike for her troubles. Her forward flight pod suffered heavy damage and caught fire. Violent decompressions erupted through the pod frame by frame, threatening to ignite the fuel lines and blow the ship to hell. The only option was to perform an emergency vent of the burning compartments, sacrificing 85 deck crew in the process. 

There was no time to waste licking their wounds, Galactica needed to get to Ragnar Station and reload so she could get back into the fight. The crew spooled up her FTL drive, crossing their fingers that it was still functional after the damage sustained and flipped the switch. The FTL drive had not been utilized in almost twenty years, and it was anyone's guess where the ship would end up. Miraculously, the FTL drive functioned as intended and moments later Galactica began its decent into the turbulent clouds of Ragnar.

Elsewhere in the system, the starliner Colonial Heavy 798 was facing its own troubles. The ship had delivered a group of civilians to the Galactica's decommissioning ceremony including clergy, the press, and the feeble offering the government had sent. President Adar couldn't make an appearance himself, so he sent the Secretary of Education, Laura Roslin. After the ceremony, 798 had departed with its passengers aboard once more for the return to Caprica with Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama (son of Commander William Adama) flying escort. The starliner received word of the attack en route. Roslin contacted the remnants of the government, who told her that after the first nuclear strikes President Adar had offered an unconditional surrender to the Cylons. The Cylons had not responded.

At this point, a single Cylon raider jumped in and scanned 798, then fired a missile at the starliner and then jumped away. Captain Adama shot down the missile, taking heavy damage to his own viper in the process in order to defend the civilian vessel. He was able to land his crippled viper in the starliner's cargo bay. 

The last message from the Colonial Government was a Case Orange message. Case Orange was a crisis fail-safe the colonials created during the First Cylon War. In the event that the government was 'decapitated', an automated message began broadcasting to those who were left. Of those who responded, the highest on a pre-determined list of succession became the new President of the Twelve Colonies. Despite being listed 43rd in line, Laura Roslin was the only one to respond and so, became the next President of the Twelve Colonies.

Roslin, Captain Adama, the 798's Captain, and other survivors piled into one of the passenger cabins for an impromptu oath of office. The senior clergy on board, an oracle named Elosha, swore her in. Thus it was that a school teacher became President of the Twelve Colonies. What was left of them.

As President, her first official act was to round up all the civilian ships stranded throughout the system. After the initial attack, all non-military vessels were ordered to a full stop, leaving them defenseless against the Cylon onslaught. President Roslin personally spear-headed the effort from aboard 798, which its Captain renamed Colonial One. Dozens of ships were recovered, including the Tauranian, a tylium refinery ship that could refuel the others. Some military craft joined the forming fleet as well, including a Raptor and several Mark VII viper craft.

By this time, Galactica was at Ragnar Station and sent word for ships to regroup at the gas giant. President Roslin refused to abandon the rescue mission and tried to countermand Adama's order. She ordered the Galactica to her position to provide assistance. This was the first of many post-invasion flare-ups between the military and civilian sectors, but it was never resolved. Before either side could make their case, another Cylon raider jumped to Colonial One's position and attacked with several nuclear missiles.

In desperation, Captain Adama rigged an EM coil that Colonial One was bringing back from Galactica and used it to disable the missiles. In the process, making it appear as if the missiles had reached their target and Colonial One destroyed. This bought them time to choose a new course of action. President Roslin was initially dead set against leaving civilians behind, but the ruse would not fool the Cylons for long. There simply was not enough time to get all the survivors aboard an FTL capable craft, and hard truths had to be faced. Many people were left to die that day. Later, some would say they were the lucky ones.

At Ragnar, the Galactica led the Colonial One and other ships into the storms. The Ragnar armory was positioned in a pocket of relative calm deep within the violent turmoil of the gas giant's atmosphere. It may have seemed like an odd place for an armory, unless you'd fought in the First Cylon War. The storms at Ragnar interfered with the silica pathways in Cylon brains. The storms also masked DRADIS signatures, so the ships within the storms were safe as well.

Galactica's crew went about collecting munitions, including several Class D nuclear warheads. The supply party also encountered a man calling himself Leoben Conoy. He claimed to be an arms dealer and said he didn't know the Cylons had returned. Introductions were cut short as one of the warhead racks being wheeled onto the Galactica tipped over, spilling its explosive cargo. Fortunately, it was explosive shells and not nukes otherwise the whole drama might have ended rather abruptly right there. As it happened, the blast trapped Commander Adama and Conoy behind a damaged bulkhead door. While the deck crew tried to free the trapped men, Conoy said that he knew a faster way out and led Adama deeper into the station. 

Conoy was clearly ill. He mentioned headaches and nausea. Adama soon realized the truth, having fought in the First Cylon War. Conoy's suffering was a clear sign that the EM interference was rotting the man's silica pathways. Conoy was a Cylon! Adama confronted Conoy and nearly got himself strangled for his trouble. Luckily, years of experience in the Colonial Fleet were on the Old Man's side. He defeated Conoy, and escaped the station with the startling and terrifying news - the Cylons now looked as human as we did, at least some models at any rate.

Back aboard Galactica, the survivors compared notes. Beyond the human form Cylons, it was evident that they were somehow able to seize control of the Command Navigation Program so all copies of the software were purged from the ships' systems. All of the Vipers were retrograded as well. Dr. Gaius Baltar was among the survivors from the bombing on Caprica and led the effort to cleanse the remaining ships of the CNP with the assistance of Galactica's staff.

Newly armed, Adama was determined to take the fight to the Cylons. He dispatched a scout to the edge of the storms, where two Cylon basestars, ten raider squadrons and two recon drone detachments had taken position to wait the human fleet's emergence from within the planet's upper atmosphere. On a good day, Galactica might have been able to take on a force half that size by herself. It was painfully obvious that a frontal assault was suicide. After discussions with President Roslin, Commander Adama came up with an escape plan. The Galactica flew just outside the storms and positioned herself between the Cylons and the civilian ships. She was reloaded and used her guns and Vipers to hold off the enemy as the civilian ships flew just clear of the storms and then jumped to safety.

A third basestar joined the battle, nearly overwhelming the Galactica but she held. As the last of the civilian ships jumped away, Galactica recalled her fighters and followed.

With that, a convoy of space-dwelling humans escaped the star system and the Cylon genocide of the Twelve Colonies. Led by the Battlestar Galactica, this rag tag fleet is on the search for Earth. The Cylons continue to pursue the remnants of the Colonies, believing that humans will always seek vengeance against them.

Any relation with Kobaia and the Magma Mithology?
It`s a french &quot;rock&quot; act whose songs tell the saga of a group of humans that separated from earth`s people to form a new society in a planet called kobaia.

Off course that`s the only simmilarity, the rest of the story is quite different. But still...

== The mythology ==

Hello,


Who wrote this article? It makes so much sense! It`s filled with spoilers though. I still haven`t made my mind wether to finish reading it or not. I wonder how you  got access to this detalided overview of the backstory. There`s a lot of things that haven`t been revealed. At least from watching the re-imagined version it`s impossible to get such an informed perspective. How did you?


jonaspd[[User:Jonaspd|Jonaspd]] 18:19, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

::It might make sense, but it's also totally untrue. It doesn't fit with the revealed mythology in the show, nor anything RDM or TPTB have commented on.  Fan Fic, pure and simple.  Wikia really sucks sometimes [[Special:Contributions/81.102.65.219|81.102.65.219]] 14:45, 26 January 2009 (UTC)

Lieutenant Starbuck is a handsome, fumarello-smoking, womanizing, smart-aleck Colonial Warrior. He's also one of Galactica's finest pilots and also the best friend of Lieutenant [[Boomer]] and Captain [[Apollo]], whose family he's become a friend of - including [[Adama]] and [[Boxey]]. He was involved with [[Athena]] for a time until he later shifted his eyes towards a Gemonese socialator and medtech [[Cassiopeia]].

Starbuck was born on Caprica in the agro settlement of Umbra. He was orphaned when a Cylon raid destroyed the settlement, and has trained to become a Viper pilot since then.

==Saga of the Star World==
Starbuck is first seen in the Bachelor Officer's Quarters when Apollo's brother Zac convinces him that he should go in his place, eager to be on recon patrol. But what started out as a routine patrol turns out to be deadly, and after Zac's death Starbuck is one of the first pilots to fly to the ''Galactica'''s defense. The peace negotiations that were supposed to be initiated turned out to be a ruse by the Cylons in order to commence a devastating attack that destroyed the Twelve Colonies. It is after the assault that Athena breaks off the relationship with Starbuck, not wanting to lose him to the Cylons like she did Zac. But Starbuck's eyes immediately wandered somewhere else after rescuing Cassiopeia from the Gemonese freighter and they bond at the life station. Athena soon catches both of them making out in the launch bay and she vents steam from the catapults on them. As the fleet finds brief respite in Carillon, Starbuck (joined by Boomer) makes his way to its casino where he not only gambles but also finds himself between Athena and Cassiopeia and even flirts with one of the singers. Joined by Apollo, Starbuck then discovers the truth behind the planet's prosperity - The natives of Carillon, the insectoid Ovions, have set up the gambling resort to lure humans to them to serve as living food for their hatching larvae in their underground chambers. They are also secretly in league with the Cylons and mine the tylium solely for their purposes in exchange for their freedom, and they are cooperating in the Cylons' efforts to eradicate the human fugitives. During a subsequent fight with Cylon soldiers, the laser fire from both parties sets the tylium mines on fire, threatening to destroy the planet once the fire rages fully out of control. But Adama has a trap of his own: the Cylons, believing that all of the pilots are at the banquet, launch a fighter attack against the Galactica in orbit, but Adama is ready to spring his trap. Once the Cylon fighter contingent is fully engaged with the Galactica, Adama recalls all his Vipers from the surface of Carillon, taking the enemy by surprise. During the fight, Apollo and Starbuck disengage from the battle and find a Cylon basestar hidden on the far side of Carillon. In defiance of Commander Adama's recall order, they decide to attempt to destroy it, in order to enable the refugee fleet to elude pursuit, and use fake radio chatter to fool the basestar into thinking it's under attack by multiple Viper squadrons. The basestar descends into Carillon's atmosphere to avoid detection, and is destroyed when the planet finally erupts in a massive tylium explosion. 

==The Tombs of Kobol==
Sometime later, Apollo is set to marry [[Serina]] which doesn't sit too well with Starbuck as he feels that the marriage is the end of his close friendship with Apollo. Both soon join Boomer and Jolly on patrol. Apollo ventures out to investigate the void and Starbuck keeps track of Apollo so they won't get lost. After they got back from patrol, they learn that Boomer and the other pilots have fallen ill and are to be placed in cryo-sleep and they have to train new pilots - majority of whom are female (the two of them being Serina and Athena). They lead these new pilots into an asteroid  and fought the Cylons there. The mission was a success, enabling the medical team to find the source of the infection that inflicted the veteran pilots. 

After visiting a recovering Boomer in the Life Station, Apollo and Starbuck feel left out (being the only male pilots who are not sick) and they begin discussing domestic duties, much to Serina's amusement. They are soon pulled by Tigh for a mission but Serina informs him that that she is Apollo's wingman much to Apollo and Tigh's surprise. Starbuck wishes them well but instead of heading back to quarters he heads for the launch bay followed shortly by Apollo and Serina. He launches in Apollo's viper but is soon captured by the Cylons and taken to a basestar. There, he strikes a friendship with Baltar's subordinate Lucifer despite being enemies. Starbuck is soon released, and then informs Apollo that the basestar he is freed from is just outside their sensor range. He leads the female warriors into battle but they are soon joined by the male warriors as they defend Kobol. Starbuck and one of the female pilots, Deitra, return to the planet just in time to witness Apollo, Adama and Serina coming out of the tombs but Serina soon winds up mortally wounded despite the warriors returning fire. Back on the ''Galactica'', Starbuck offers to watch Muffit so that Serina's young son Boxey can say goodbye to his dying mother.

==The Long Patrol==
Starbuck and Boomer offered Boxey to spend the night with them in the Bachelor Officer's Quarters where they play pyramid using some candy, then launch to rescue the stranded Apollo as soon as Boxey had to go to bed. 

Sometime after, Starbuck has volunteered to test a new prototype Viper fitted for extended-range reconnaissance and soon embarks on his mission after spending some time juggling between Athena and Cassiopeia aboard the ''Rising Star''. Starbuck dons a generic black flight suit/uniform (so as not to be identified as a Colonial warrior by potential Cylon allies) and flies off in the new fighter – which has superior speed and maneuverability, but at the lack of weaponry. The ship is also equipped with a flirtatious computer called CORA. Running recon ahead of the fleet, Starbuck encounters an old starfighter chasing a small cargo shuttle. Starbuck intervenes by distracting the fighter so that the shuttle can escape. The fighter breaks off and Starbuck follows the shuttle to a nearby world where he discovers the pilot is a smuggler hauling crates of ambrosia – a very expensive beverage and a favorite of Starbucks. While Starbuck admires the drink, the shuttle pilot strikes him from behind and knocks him out. The Smuggler then steals the Viper. Starbuck regains consciousness, and seeing his Viper gone, takes off in the smuggler's shuttle. Upon reaching orbit, he is attacked by the same fighter he drove off earlier. The fighter pilot calls him &quot;Robber&quot;, but Starbuck eventually convinces him that he is not the man he thinks he is. The fighter orders Starbuck to follow him to a nearby planet. Upon landing, guards inspect the shuttle and find the ambrosia. They arrest Starbuck for bootlegging despite his pleas of innocence. He is thrown in a cell and given the new name of &quot;Bootlegger 137&quot;. After conversing with other prisoners – who are likewise named for their crime and a number (such as Embezzler 10, Murderer 7 etc.) – Starbuck learns they are actually the descendents of the original inmates and being held for the crimes committed by their ancestors. He then realizes he is on a long forgotten Colonial penal colony called Proteus. The prison uses penal labor to manufacture munitions and large amounts of ambrosia for the Colonial military, but Colonial government eventually lost contact with the colony and assumed it destroyed. Starbuck also learns that there is a sizable stockpile of ambrosia that has been sitting on the docks for over a century and he dreams of the money it could bring. He soon causes an uprising after discovering that the prisoners were duped into being slaves by making ambrosia. Apollo and Boomer, along with the smuggler who had stolen his advanced Viper, rescue Starbuck and he is reunited with CORA. They are now aware that a Cylon patrol has intercepted the old merchant signal from the advanced Viper and are on their way to Proteus. The three warriors engage the Cylons, who then destroyed all the ambrosia when they attacked the docks - robbing Starbuck of his dreams of being rich. Once the fleet arrives at Proteus, Starbuck's safe return is celebrated with a dinner aboard the Rising Star. There Boxey presents his father, Apollo, with a drawing of Earth's solar system as described to him by his grandfather Adama. When Starbuck sees the &quot;map&quot; he notices it is similar to a drawing he saw in his cell at the prison. The smuggler friend, who also attends the dinner, says the drawing in the cell was made by &quot;the silent one&quot; – a mysterious prisoner that had long since died. Adama wonders if the man had found Earth.

'''Karl Agathon''' was an officer within the [[Colonial Fleet]] and is the father of modern day humans which evolved from Hera after the colonization of earth by colonials and rebel cylon, he is a fervent believer in cylon-human peace.

Appearances
[edit]
Background

Agathon is an Electronic Countermeasures Officer, part of a two-person Colonial Raptor crew based on the Battlestar Galactica, and is paired with Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii before the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies. Unlike other major characters such as Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace or Gaius Baltar, the series reveals little about Agathon's life before the events of the series. It is confirmed Helo is a Caprican, which is partly why he and Starbuck knew each other.[1]

The (unofficial) backstory Tahmoh Penikett and Katee Sackhoff came up with to explain a comment from Thrace in &quot;Scattered&quot; that she and Helo &quot;go way back&quot; is the two were old friends for a long time who most likely attended the academy together as cadets and as &quot;drinking buddies.&quot;[2][3][4][5][6]
[edit]
Miniseries

During the Cylon attack, Agathon and Sharon's Raptor is damaged, he takes a shrapnel hit in the leg and they are forced to land on Caprica. While making repairs, they are mobbed by a group of survivors desperate to get off the planet. A lottery is used to decide who will be allowed to escape due to the Raptor's limited space. The injured Agathon sacrifices his own seat to allow Dr. Gaius Baltar, discovered in the crowd, to survive. Boomer lifts off with refugees aboard and Helo is left on the nuked and occupied Caprica with only a med kit and sidearm. [7]
[edit]
Series

After the Raptor leaves, Agathon flees into the wilderness and tries to elude Cylon forces, surviving by using anti-radiation injections and the other contents of his survival kit. Eventually, he is captured by a Number Six copy, but is rescued by Valerii (unknown to Agathon, his rescuer is another copy of Cylon model Number Eight).[8] Valerii's true motive in accompanying Agathon is the participation in a Cylon experiment designed to attempt to create a viable Cylon/human hybrid offspring. The Cylons track Agathon's progress toward a military base in Delphi, placing him in situations designed to result in affection and ultimately love towards Valerii. The experiment results in a successful pregnancy after Valerii has sex with Agathon,[9] though as an unintended side effect, she falls in love with him as well.[10] Agathon soon discovers the truth about her Cylon nature after spotting another Number Eight copy while trying to infiltrate the Delphi military base. Believing that he is being led into a trap, he runs from the base and Valerii.[11]

She eventually catches up to him and reveals she is pregnant. Despite shooting her in the shoulder, Agathon realizes he can't bring himself to kill her and instead, at her urging, takes her with him to the Delphi museum. It is there he is reunited with fellow Galactica pilot Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace, who is on a special mission from President Laura Roslin to recover the Arrow of Apollo.[12] After nearly being killed by Thrace, Valerii steals the Cylon Raider and flies off.[13] Agathon and Thrace make their way first to Thrace's old apartment to retrieve a new mode of transportation (an old army truck she owned),[14] and then into the woods in search of another military base. While stopping to get their bearings, they run into a group of Pyramid players-turned resistance fighters.[15] After Thrace is wounded and captured by the Cylons, Agathon and the others track her down and attempt to rescue her from the hospital where she is being held. They are, surprisingly, aided by Valerii, who returns in a stolen Heavy Raider. With the Arrow of Apollo in hand, Agathon, Thrace and Valerii leave Caprica and make their way to Kobol to rejoin Roslin.[16]

Upon rejoining the Colonial survivors aboard the Astral Queen, Agathon pulls his gun on Lee Adama in order to stop him from shooting Valerii, whom Adama blames for the attempt another Valerii copy makes on his father's life. Later, while searching for the Tomb of Athena on the surface of Kobol, Agathon admits to Valerii he still loves and trusts her.[17]

After finding the Tomb of Athena, Agathon returns with the group to Galactica, almost three months after being MIA and presumed dead. His homecoming is bittersweet; Helo's former friends turn their backs on him due to his love for a Cylon — let alone one whose doppelgänger attempted to murder the beloved Commader William Adama. However, Helo finds support from Starbuck and Chief Petty Officer Galen Tyrol, who was in love with the original Galactica crew member version of Sharon before her ultimate betrayal of the fleet and death.[18] Helo eventually is accepted by the crew when he recommends the Blackbird should be encased in carbon-composite skin to make it a stealth ship.

After the appearance of the Battlestar Pegasus, Agathon witnesses Sharon's torture and attempted rape by Lieutenant Alastair Thorne, a Pegasus crew member and Cylon interrogator. Along with Tyrol, Helo stops Thorne from raping Sharon but in the process, they accidentally kill him. (This incident is subject to subtly different editing. In the DVD version of the episode, they interrupt Thorne while he is raping Sharon; in the broadcast version, they arrive just in time to prevent it.) Admiral Cain's summary trial and death sentence of Agathon and Tyrol bring Galactica to confrontation with Pegasus.[19] Although the death sentence is not carried out, Agathon and Tyrol remain in the brig, where Tyrol ultimately gives Helo his blessing for a relationship with Sharon. The two are eventually released by Colonel Jack Fisk, with all charges being dropped.[20]

Following his captivity on Pegasus, Helo is reunited with his version of Sharon as her pregnancy continues. When President Laura Roslin proclaims her intention to force Sharon to undergo an abortion in order to eliminate the perceived threat Helo and Sharon's child represents to the fleet, Helo begs Admiral Adama to overrule Roslin and allow himself and the pregnant Sharon to leave the fleet and find a world where they could live in peace without being persecuted. Adama refuses and Roslin rescinds her demand for a forced abortion when Gaius Baltar extracts blood from the unborn child for use as a cure for Roslin's terminal cancer.[21] This leads to Roslin betraying Helo again by ordering Helo and Sharon's newborn daughter to be taken from the hospital after she is born. The infant's death is faked and Helo is given what are ostensibly her ashes, which he and Tyrol release into space.[22]

Following the discovery and settlement of New Caprica, Agathon remains on Galactica as part of her skeleton crew. He is promoted to Captain and serves as Galactica's executive officer (XO), replacing Colonel Saul Tigh. Karl Agathon marries his version of Sharon Valerii, who is commissioned as a Lieutenant in the Colonial Fleet[23][24] and takes the call sign &quot;Athena&quot;.[25]

During an attempt by Galactica to spread a virus in order to wipe out the Cylon race, Agathon disobeys orders and sabotages a key part of the plan in order to prevent the elimination of the Cylon race because he considers such an action to be genocidal, and therefore profoundly immoral.[26]

When Colonel Tigh finally returns to the position of Galactica's XO after a long depression brought on by his experiences on New Caprica (in particular his execution of his wife, Ellen, for collaboration), Agathon returns to the flight line. He pilots one of the Raptors used to guide the fleet through a nearly un-navigable and highly radioactive stellar cluster. He becomes one of the second highest pilots left after the deaths of Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace and Louanne &quot;Kat&quot; Katraine. He is next in line with Ricky &quot;Two Times&quot; Richardson and Marcia &quot;Showboat&quot; Case, respectively.[27]

Two weeks after the death of Kara, Helo takes over as C.A.G. (Commander, Air Group) from the still visibly shaken Lee Adama, who is subsequently removed by Admiral Adama. Mere days later, he once again temporarily replaces Col. Tigh as XO, when it becomes apparent the latter has returned to the bottle.

Helo returns to his duties as CAG after Colonel Tigh returns to duty. When Starbuck returns Helo is placed second in command on the Demetrius in the mission to find earth. During the mission to destroy the Hub, Helo rescued the Number Three D'Anna before the Hub was destroyed.

During the mutiny Helo was beaten unconscious by the mutineers and thrown in the brig along with his wife and daughter. After the mutiny was resolved, he and his family returned to life as usual. This equilibrium was disrupted when Boomer, the Raptor pilot he had formerly served with, impersonated his wife and allowed him to seduce her (while Athena, bound in a closet, watched in helpless fury), and then abducted Hera for study. Boomer fled with the child to the Colony, where John Cavil intended to dissect her to determine the secrets leading to her conception. In the aftermath of the abduction, with Athena in a listless depression, Helo begged Adama to let him take out a Raptor for a search-and-rescue mission, despite the risk he would not find her—or, for that matter, return. (Adama, stern if sympathetic, denied the request.)

When Adama finally obtained the location of the Colony, Helo and Athena were among the many who volunteered to crew Galactica for the attack-and-rescue mission. He devised the plan of using Raptors as boarding craft, inserting small teams of Marines into the Colony—a plan made extremely dangerous by the dense asteroid agglomeration and gravitational distortions caused by the Colony's orbit around a black hole. He and Athena were the only Raptor crew to survive the entire process of insertion, combat and withdrawal, but (with a little help from a repentant Boomer) successfully retrieved their daughter. Shortly thereafter, Galactica herself was boarded, and Helo was shot in the thigh. Hera fled the scene, and, despite knowing he would die of blood loss unless Sharon attended him, Helo demanded she protect their daughter.

Helo did not appear again until the last few minutes of the episode. Though he used a walking stick to counter his limp, he was still alive, still mobile, and evidently not severely distressed by his injury; instead, he bantered with Sharon over what they would teach Hera (and who should get to teach it) on this new planet called Earth.
 
 Karl Agathon's dog tags

While Karl and Sharon Agathon passed namelessly into history, Hera was eventually identified by Earth scientists as &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19710">'''Sharon Valerii / Number Eight''', also known as Lieutenant Junior Grade Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii, and Lieutenant Junior Grade Sharon 'Athena' Valerii Agathon, refer to a collection of humanoid Cylon characters on the television series Battlestar Galactica, a reimagining of the classic show of the same name. They are portrayed by Grace Park. Two prominent Number Eight copies named &quot;Sharon Valerii&quot; have served as Galactica pilots using the respective call signs &quot;Boomer&quot; and &quot;Athena&quot;.

==Versions==
Many Number Eight copies have been seen in various Cylon-occupied areas and in leadership positions; two are featured as central characters. A multitude of Eights are found aboard the Basestar orbiting [[Kobol]] that Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii destroys. Another Eight is shown as a Cylon leader when both main character Eights are elsewhere.

===Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii===
Lieutenant Junior Grade Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii is a Cylon sleeper agent programmed to believe that she is human. For example, she has been implanted with false memories of being raised on [[Troy]] by her parents Katherine and Abraham Valerii, who supposedly died in an accident that killed all the members on the mining colony. Whether or not Katherine and Abraham actually existed is unknown. In the time before the mini-series, Boomer and Chief Galen Tyrol are romantically involved, despite the fact that their relationship is against military protocol (she is an officer, he is enlisted). Due to her programming, she performs a number of sabotage actions (including bombing the Galactica's water tanks). She has no conscious memory of doing so. In time she begins to suspect something may be wrong with her. She even asks [[Gaius Baltar]] to administer a blood test to find out if she is a Cylon. Although his test demonstrates that she is in fact a Cylon, he decides to not inform anyone of his findings out of fear that she will kill him. In fact, Baltar has decided to report any tests that turn up: &quot;Cylon&quot; as human--he sees it as a more peaceful way to proceed, perhaps selfishly. She is greatly relieved for a while, but over time becomes increasingly aware that something is wrong with her, and even attempts suicide. Tyrol hides evidence that would implicate her in the water bombing, but later suspicious events cause him to break off his relationship with her.

Sharon's self-awareness is confirmed following the assignment resulting in the base star's destruction. After returning to Galactica, she shoots Commander William Adama, putting him in a coma. She and Tyrol (suspected of being a Cylon because of his relationship with her) are put in the brig, interrogated and brutalized by Colonel [[Saul Tigh]], who has taken command of Galactica in Adama's incapacity. Gaius Baltar ultimately forces her to tell him how many other Cylons were onboard by injecting Tyrol with a substance that stopped his heart, and refusing to administer the antidote. Sharon informs Gaius that there are eight Cylons in the fleet. She is shot and killed by Specialist Cally, who blames her for Tyrol's imprisonment; Cally herself is in love with Tyrol as is made clear in later episodes. Sharon dies in Tyrol's arms. Her last words are, &quot;I love you, Chief.&quot;

In the episode &quot;Downloaded&quot;, it is revealed that Boomer's consciousness has been downloaded into a new body. She still resists being identified with the Cylon cause. &quot;Boomer&quot; is viewed as a hero among the Cylons, but in this episode she and fellow Cylon Caprica-Six, transformed by their love for humans in previous incarnations, decide to try to persuade the Cylons that some of their actions against mankind are wrong. Because of her and Six's actions, she is, for a time, threatened with &quot;being boxed&quot; that is, to have her consciousness put into &quot;cold storage&quot; rather than downloaded into a new body when the current one is killed/dies. She is among the Cylons that find New Caprica and tries to show that humans and Cylons can co-exist, and functions as a member of the Cylon governing council that controls the puppet human government under President Gaius Baltar. She seems to have accepted herself as a Cylon and is fully integrated back into their society.

On a Cylon Base Ship, Boomer has been seen attempting to care for Athena's hybrid child Hera, who is mysteriously ill. She is frustrated by the child's deteriorating health and their inability to bond even though Boomer has &quot;tried everything&quot;. Athena arrives on the Base Ship and determines that Hera would best be treated by a human doctor. Boomer accuses her of having planned to take Hera back to Galactica from the start. Boomer says that the failure of New Caprica has taught her that humans and Cylons can't co-exist and that they should go their separate ways, and thinks that Brother Cavil may be right that the Cylons aren't supposed to have children. She threatens to snap Hera's neck, but her own neck is snapped by Caprica-Six for endangering the future of the Cylon race.

Shortly thereafter, Valerii would once again resurrect. During the Battle of the Ionian Nebula, the Cylon Raiders became aware of the presence of the Final Five in the Colonial Fleet and in consequence ceased their attack. A Number One known as Cavil insisted that the Raiders should undergo a procedure to remove or at least reduce their sentience. He managed to rally the support of the Number Fives and the Number Fours; however, the Number Twos, Sixes and Eights voted against the procedure. In response to this, Cavil enlisted the aid of Sharon Valerii who broke the stalemate in favour of making the Raiders effective fighters once again. In turn, she became the first Cylon to ever vote against her own model (meaning that in a six-vote block, she cast an unheard-of seventh vote). Natalie (a Number Six model) demands that Cavil stop the Raider lobotomies. When Cavil refuses, Natalie calls in two Centurions, which then engage their weapons. Cavil orders the Centurions to leave, but they refuse the order. Natalie withdraws a device saying she has removed the Centurions' higher brain inhibitors and they are now able to reason. She told them what is happening to the Raiders and they have come to stop it. The Centurions then gun down Cavil and the other humanoid Cylons in the room.

It is not known if Valerii herself was symbolically executed by Natalie’s faction; however, she was present during Cavil’s resurrection and kissed him once he had composed himself. In response to Natalie’s use of force, Cavil devised a plot to eliminate the opposition Cylons (including Sharon’s own ‘sisters’). Cavil informed the Twos, Sixes and Eights that in order for the Number Threes to be resurrected, the Cylon fleet would need to make several jumps to what he calls the ‘hub’. Upon arrival at the location, the Basestars under the control of Valerii and Cavil attack the opposition Cylon ships. The Resurrection Ship was deliberately left behind so that any deaths that occur in the battle will be final. Boomer expresses doubt and sadness for the deaths of her &quot; own sisters&quot;, and when Cavil says that the souls of the others will be looked after by God, she asks, &quot;what about our souls?&quot; Cavil replies, &quot;We're machines, machines don't have souls.&quot;

Valerii was present at the resurrection of the Number Three model known as D’anna Biers. Shortly thereafter, the Cylon Rebels and pilots from the Colonial Fleet would attack the Resurrection Hub; the Rebels and humans are successful in rescuing D’anna from the Hub prior to it being destroyed. The fate of Valerii, as well as that of the Cylons who participated in the raid, is unclear as of the end of Season 4, but as she was not seen leaving the Hub before it was destroyed--and as several nearby Basestars were destroyed due to their proximity to the nuclear detonations which destroyed the Hub--it is likely that she is permanently dead. However, as Cavil and Boomer would have had to taken the Cylon equivalent of a Raptor to board the Hub, it is likely she left the Hub on it, and therefore could have jumped away during the attacks.

===Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon===
Another instance of Sharon, who is fully aware of her true nature, also appears in the series. This Sharon also seemed to possess memories of the experiences of Boomer (at least until the later episodes of the first season), including memories of her relationship with Tyrol. She expresses happiness for Tyrol and Cally, who now have a child together.

====Cylon-occupied Caprica====
She first appears when she joins then-Lieutenant Karl 'Helo' Agathon after he is stranded on the Cylon-occupied planet Caprica. She pretends to be the &quot;original&quot; Sharon who had returned to help him, when in fact she is working with the other Cylons on an experiment to have him fall in love with her. While her intentions at the beginning of the experiment are strictly part of the Cylon plan, she eventually falls genuinely in love with Helo, and tries to help him escape from the other Cylons. Helo discovers her true identity when he sees another Number Eight copy on Caprica (who attempts to kill him but is shot by Sharon), but Sharon eventually convinces him that she loves him, and also reveals that she is pregnant with his child. This pregnancy is the first successful attempt at a humanoid-Cylon/Human Hybrid, and as a result is of great importance to the Cylons.

While on Caprica, Sharon and Helo encounter Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace, who realises that Sharon is a Cylon &quot;copy&quot; and attempts to shoot her, but is stopped by Helo. Sharon flees in Starbuck's captured Cylon Raider, casting doubt on her intentions. She returns later to aid Helo and a human resistance movement rescue Starbuck from a Cylon facility. Though only Helo trusts her, the group allows Sharon to accompany them as they rejoin President Laura Roslin's portion of the Colonial fleet, separated from Galactica.

====Return to the Colonial Fleet====
Sharon's life is again threatened upon her return to the Colonial fleet after William Adama's attempted assassination and Boomer's death. When Lee 'Apollo' Adama attempts to shoot her and Helo intervenes, then when Roslin orders her thrown out an airlock until she uses her knowledge of the Tomb of Athena on Kobol as leverage. She demonstrates her loyalty several times in defending the group from Cylon ambushes during the trip to the tomb, even though she is chained and not entirely trusted.

Sharon's reunion with other Galactica personnel on Kobol is also tense, as then-Commander Adama initially attempts to strangle her. Her relationship with Tyrol is complicated by the events involving Boomer, as well as her romantic involvement with Helo. Despite Adama's animosity, she saves his life by exposing a plot to kill him by one of terrorist/politician Tom Zarek's followers. She tells them, &quot;I'm Sharon, but I'm a different Sharon. I know who I am. I don't have hidden protocols or programs lying in wait to be activated. I make my own choices, I make my own decisions, and I need you to know this is my choice.&quot; Still, she is imprisoned upon returning to Galactica and is treated as an enemy by all but Helo and Tyrol.

Sharon again demonstrates her loyalty when the Galactica is threatened by a Cylon computer virus, and uses her Cylon capabilities to instead turn the virus against the large approaching Cylon raider attack force, allowing the Colonial pilots to completely destroy the enemy. Although she performs this action, she seems conflicted and pained by its repercussions (mainly the subsequent slaughter of raiders). This event causes Roslin and Adama to re-evaluate their attitude towards her, and earns her significant trust. She makes several other valuable contributions to the human cause, offering intelligence and advice on various Cylon situations.

When the Battlestar Pegasus is reunited with the Colonial fleet and its commander, Rear Admiral Helena Cain discovers Sharon's presence, Sharon is turned over to Pegasus's &quot;Cylon Interrogator&quot;, Lt. Thorne. Thorne beats Sharon and attempts to rape her (he does in the extended version), but is killed when Helo and Tyrol intervene.

====Pregnancy and birth====
Sharon's unborn hybrid child is threatened when Roslin orders the pregnancy terminated, outraging Sharon and Helo. Roslin later relents when blood from the fetus is found to be able to cure her terminal cancer. The pregnancy is allowed to continue, and in &quot;Downloaded&quot;, Sharon gives birth to her child prematurely, via an emergency cesarean section. The daughter is named Hera. As the baby is deemed a risk to the Fleet if raised by her Cylon mother, Hera's death is faked by Dr. Cottle. The baby is given to a human mother to raise, unbeknownst to either Sharon or Helo. Told that Hera died from breathing complications, Sharon assumes that Hera was killed by the Galactica crew and attacks Dr. Cottle and turns on Helo. She later helps navigate a mission to rescue survivors on Caprica. Her loyalty is again called into question when she chooses not to inform the Colonials that one of the survivors is a Cylon.

====Post-occupation of New Caprica====
In Season 3's &quot;Occupation&quot;, it is revealed that during the year-long gap between the events of seasons 2 and 3 Sharon and Helo were married, and Sharon took Helo's surname, Agathon. With the Galactica in need of pilots after the return of the Cylons, and having earned the full trust of Admiral Adama, Sharon is sworn in as an officer in the Colonial Fleet, regaining Boomer's rank of Lieutenant JG. She is sent back to New Caprica as the liaison between the Galactica fleet and the resistance effort on the ground as a precursor to an attempt to free the subjugated humans from the occupying Cylons. Adama explained that she was the ideal agent, since Centurions cannot tell her from any of the other Eights. Sharon infiltrates the Cylon Base, and is able to steal the keys for the civilian ships, thus making Adama's escape plan possible. When leaving with the keys, she encounters a D'Anna Biers, a Number Three, who informs her that her child Hera is still alive.

After the successful rescue of the colonists, Sharon gains a measure of acceptance among the Galactica's pilots. When Racetrack refers to her by the old call sign 'Boomer', she replies that 'Boomer' was somebody else. The other pilots in the rec room offer suggestions for a new call-sign. Many of them affectionately tease her for being a Cylon and suggesting names like &quot;Tin Can&quot; and &quot;Titanium&quot;. &quot;Hot Dog&quot; suggests Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, and Sharon proudly accepts it.

Athena displays the ability to identify individual Number Eight copies, identifying Boomer (who shot Admiral Adama at the end of Season 1) when she arrives aboard Galactica to negotiate with Admiral Adama. When Colonel Tigh bars Boomer from the meeting, she repeats Number Three's message that Hera is still alive, but ailing, aboard a basestar. Adama confirms this information in a tense conversation with President Roslin. Both Athena and Helo express feelings of outrage that their child was stolen from them. Athena demands at the end of Season 3 episode 11, that she be able to see her daughter.

As there is no way that Adama would let her visit the Base Ship, Athena is shot by Helo and downloaded on the Cylon resurrection ship. A Six (who is presumed to be Caprica-Six) brings Athena to the room on the Base Ship where Boomer is caring for the child. Athena insists that Hera's illness could be cured by the human doctors on Galactica, a possibility that neither Six nor Boomer wish to consider. Athena and Boomer have a heated discussion on the fate of the child. Boomer expresses a desire to abandon the experiment entirely and kill the child. Before Athena can intervene, Six promptly kills Boomer for considering the death of the child. Before their actions can be discovered, Six whisks Athena and Hera to a raptor, and the trio escape to Galactica.

Athena's abilities as a pilot are recognized and she is given the most important missions for Raptor pilots. Sharon discovers that she, Hera, President Roslin and Caprica Six are all sharing the same recurring dream but are unaware of what it means. Athena served aboard the Demetrius, to help Kara Thrace try to find Earth.

Athena later shot and killed Natalie because she saw the Number 6 as a threat to Hera due to the dreams of the Opera House that she had been having.

===Other Versions===
*A copy joins a group of Twos, Fives, and Sixes at Ragnar Anchorage after Galactica and the fleet depart having stranded &quot;Aaron Doral.&quot; This copy declares that the humans will be hunted down, and a Six replies, &quot;By your command.&quot;
*A copy wearing a white coat at the Spaceport at Delphi, whom Athena kills before the other Eight can shoot Helo.
*Multiple naked copies aboard the basestar above Kobol, which Boomer was sent to destroy and upon which she learns her identity as a Cylon.
*A copy who sits in a movie theatre (with other Cylon models) and watches the footage sent from the Fleet by [[D'Anna Biers]] (it can be assumed that it is the same one that Athena shot because she wears the same coat as the above mentioned copy).
*Copies who act as &quot;nurses&quot; or &quot;midwives,&quot; aiding the respective resurrections of Caprica Six and Boomer.
*Several copies on Cylon-occupied Caprica going through daily life in the episode &quot;[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]&quot;, wearing a variety of outfits.
*Copies who are killed when [[Samuel Anders]] and [[Galen Tyrol]] detonate a bomb near a Cylon Heavy Raider.
*A copy who sits next to Boomer during a meeting on Colonial One (during the New Caprican occupation), when the suicide bombings are discussed.
*Multiple copies aboard the basestar that Caprica Six and Baltar inhabit.
*Multiple copies dying aboard a diseased basestar.
*A copy, dying from a disease aboard a basestar, who is taken captive by Galactica. Later, she and the rest of the Cylon prisoners are killed by Helo in an attempt to prevent genocide against the Cylons. This copy, despite calling Sharon a traitor, showed typical Eight concern for her and warned her to stay away due to the disease.
* Multiple copies who approach Athena on the rebel basestar, asking her to lead a rebellion against the Sixes. Athena expresses disgust with their typical Eight fickleness.
* A copy shot and killed by a Centurion while attempting to unplug the Hybrid. She is comforted by Anders in her final moments after Athena refuses to do so.
* The Eight copy partnered with Helo who had downloaded Athena's memories.
* The Eights in flight uniforms during the briefing for the attack on the Resurrection Hub.
* The dead Eights Helo sees aboard the Resurrection Hub.

==Typical Eight Traits==
Unlike most other Cylon models, the Eights typically show a great deal of concern and affection. This affection is especially strong towards other Eights, who they often refer to as &quot;sisters&quot;. The Eights tend to be the most naive of the models and often have difficulty understanding typical human emotional responses. The Eights also have a propensity for fickleness, often changing loyalties to better suit their own needs and desires.

==Call Sign Origins==
The call signs for both Sharon characters derive from the names of characters in the original Battlestar Galactica series. Boomer was the name (not the call sign) of a Viper pilot character played by Herb Jefferson, Jr.. Sharon Agathon's call sign, Athena, in the original series was the name of Commander Adama's daughter Lieutenant Athena. Athena was the sister of Apollo with the duties of bridge officer, shuttle pilot, and occasional Viper pilot.

'''Helena Cain''' was the commander of the [[Battlestar Pegasus (RDM)|Battlestar Pegasus]].
==Biography==
===Youth===
As a 9-year-old girl on her home colony of [[Tauron]], Helena witnessed her parents' deaths during a [[Cylons|Cylon]] attack on the final day of the first [[Cylon War]]. She fled with her sister, Lucy, but the younger sibling stumbled in the rubble. Too injured to continue, Lucy pleaded for help from her older sister, but Helena froze and, seeing a Cylon landing party, ran away and hid in a nearby storage container. She was discovered there by a [[Cylon Centurions|Centurion]] sentry. As it targeted her, she picked up a folding knife and prepared to defend herself. Before the Centurion could strike, however, it received orders that a treaty had been signed and departed.

Now safe, Helena returned to where she left her sister, but the younger girl was missing. Only her doll remained. Looking into the sky, she sees a Cylon ship depart. It becomes clear that her sister has been taken for what can only be presumed is further experimentation towards creating a human Cylon hybrid. In the aftermath, Helena vowed to do whatever it took to survive.

===In The Colonial Fleet===
Cain later made a name for herself as an ambitious officer in the Colonial Fleet. She was something of a rising star with strong political connections: Commander [[William Adama]] later remarks to [[Laura Roslin|President Laura Roslin]] that she was promoted &quot;to Rear Admiral over half the Commanders on the list&quot;. However, her rapid rise in the Colonial Fleet appears more than likely due to her &quot;strong political connections&quot; than actual performance.

===Cylon Attack===
Prior to the destruction of the [[Twelve Colonies]], Cain's flagship, the [[Battlestar Pegasus]], was docked at the Scorpion Fleet Shipyards for a major refit. The refit team included a civilian network analyst, [[Number Six|Gina Inviere]], with whom Cain initiated a lesbian relationship. At the time of the attack, Admiral Cain, like many of her crew, was preparing to leave the ship on shore leave. The initial Cylon strike destroyed five Colonial vessels in Pegasus' immediate vicinity and severely damaged the Pegasus herself, killing 700 crew members. In a desperate gamble, Admiral Cain ordered a &quot;blind jump&quot; that took the Pegasus out of the combat zone.&amp;nbsp
In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Cain addressed her crew, promising revenge against the Cylons through a guerrilla-style war. Among her inner circle, however, she said she was not willing to foolishly risk lives in the pursuit of vengeance.&amp;nbsp
During the attack, Cain became impressed by the fortitude of her new aide, a young, impressionable officer named [[Kendra Shaw]], and quickly took the young girl under her wing, giving her the knife she found as a child. Shaw worked with Gina to restore the Pegasus computers, and they discovered a [[Cylon communications relay]] nearby. Cain saw this as the perfect opportunity to strike back at the Cylons and ordered a surprise attack. After jumping into range of the relay, a fleet of Cylon Raiders jumped in and attacked Pegasus. Pegasus executive officer Colonel [[Jurgen Belzen]] suspected that the Cylon relay was a trap and suggested a strategic retreat. Belzen's suspicions soon proved to be correct. However, Cain doubted his judgment, instead preferring to launch a full counterstrike, hoping it would catch the Cylons by surprise. This strategy did not work out at all as Cain had planned. When Belzen questioned Cain's decision and refused to carry out her foolish order to continue with the attack Cain ordered Colonel Belzen to hand over his sidearm. He reluctantly handed over his pistol, and Cain shot him in the head with it. She then appointed Colonel [[Jack Fisk]] as executive officer and ordered him to launch the attack. Shocked by Belzen's execution, Fisk immediately agreed to carry out the order.
The Cylons managed to board the Pegasus during the attack, leading to the discovery of Gina as a Cylon agent. With this betrayal, heightened by her relationship with a Cylon infiltrator, Cain ordered Lt. [[Alastair Thorne]] to brutally interrogate the prisoner.&amp;nbsp
Pegasus then found 15 refugee civilian ships, but rather than protect them like Galactica did, Admiral Cain unscrupulously opted to strip these civilian vessels of any useful parts and supplies, draft any civilians who had valuable technical experience into her crew, and then leave the remaining civilians aboard their ships defenseless and at the mercy of the Cylons. If any civilians refused to join the Pegasus crew, Cain ordered that their families be executed. Overall, two families were killed under her orders until the draftees relented.

===Meeting Galactica===
Six months after the Cylon holocaust, Pegasus was tracking a Cylon fleet when it accidentally encountered Galactica and her civilian ships. Taking over from Commander Adama as military commander of the fleet, Admiral Cain quickly arranges for Galactica's stores to be replenished from Pegasus's own, but neglects the civilian fleet, ignoring President Laura Roslin's requests on their behalf.
Cain's chief military objective became identifying a mysterious Cylon vessel sighted in the fleet pursuing Galactica. Cain gives Dr. Gaius Baltar access to Gina to continue the interrogation and learn more about the ship, identified as a Cylon Resurrection ship. The strategic value of knocking out the Cylons' means of avoiding death is not lost on the Colonial military commanders, and so Pegasus and Galactica plan a joint operation to engage the Cylon fleet and destroy the Resurrection ship.

Concurrently with this operation, Admiral Cain and Commander Adama come into conflict over the treatment of two Galactica crew members, [[Karl Agathon|Lt. Karl Agathon]] and [[Galen Tyrol|Chief Galen Tyrol]]. Admiral Cain sentences the pair to death for the murder of a Pegasus officer, Cylon interrogator Thorne. Cain and Adama come to the brink of firing on one another's vessels before standing down and agreeing to postpone their disagreements until the Resurrection ship has been destroyed. Nonetheless, each makes plans to have the other assassinated following the successful completion of the operation. Neither plan is carried out, much to the relief of the respective assassins: [[Kara Thrace|Captain Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace]] and Colonel Fisk.

===Death===
Unknown to Cain, [[Gaius Baltar|Baltar]] also once had a relationship with a Six, and still has visions of one influencing his decisions. As he interrogated Gina, Baltar fell in love with her. After the Resurrection Ship is destroyed, Baltar tells Gina she deserves justice and helps her escape. Gina kills her guard, steals his gun, and makes her way to Cain's ready room and shoots Cain in the head. After her death, Cain is eulogized by both Colonel Fisk and Captain Thrace, who says they are weaker without her. However, all the weaknesses appear to come from the Pegasus command. Admiral Cain showed a tendency to carry out a vendetta against the Cylons going so far as to steal supplies and take essential personnel from Colonial ships and leave the survivors defenseless to the Cylons. Col. Jack Fisk was part of a thriving black market until he was assassinated; chief engineer and third in command Barry Garner proved to be incompetent; Colonel Jurgen Belzen was shot dead by Cain because he refused to carry out one of her orders to attack the Cylons even after he pointed out to her it could be an obvious trap.

Is a Federated, Presidential System and Multi-Ethnocratic based planetary coalition government in the Battlestar Galactica universe. The '''Twelve Colonies''' spun around a single star on elliptical orbits. Closest to the sun was sweltering, volcanic [[Canceron]], the greatest source of tylium in the system. Next came a Trojan orbit of planets -- three wo[[File:Epic-map-of-battlestar-galactica-8217-s-12-colonies_1.jpg|thumb]]rlds following the same orbital path, seperated by roughly the same distance (one-sixth the orbit's diameter). In order, these planets were [[Aquaria]], [[Caprica]], and [[Virgon]]. They were centers of art, culture, and system-wide trade.

Two gas giants followed, each in its own elliptical path and each itself orbited by a number of moons. The first of these behemoths was Zeus, named after the king of the gods, and its moons were [[Leonis]], [[Picon]], and [[Scorpia]]. Another large planet named [[Aerelon]] shared Zeus' orbit, positioned exactly opposite the giant. The second gas giant was Hera and her charges were [[Gemenon]] and [[Libris]], with [[Sagittaron]] likewise spinning opposite. These giants and their moons were the heart of the system. This real estate was the most heavily contested during the colonies' many civil wars.

At the outermost edge of the system dwelled [[Tauron]], followed by a third gas giant named [[Ragnar]]. Tauron was the first world settled after the fall of [[Kobol]]. It was the springboard for all expansion in the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4341">Number Six (Caprica-Six / Shelly Godfrey / Gina Inviere / Natalie Faust / Lida / Sonja)[[File:Caprica-Six.jpg|thumb]]&lt;br /&gt;

The first model explicitly revealed to be a Cylon in the mini-series, the Sixes often use seduction to their advantage. Important copies include Shelly Godfrey, Gina Inviere, Head Six, Caprica Six, and Natalie.

One of the models, later known as Caprica Six, on her way to meet with Dr. Gaius Baltar, murdered an infant by breaking its neck. This could either be considered sociopathic, or a mercy killing due to the coming Cylon attack. She went on to save Baltar's life when his house was struck by a blast wave from the Cylon attack on Caprica.

Caprica Six has a love-hate relationship with Gaius Baltar, alternately defending him to other Cylon models or leaving him to suffer at their hands and progressing to reinitiating a sexual relationship with him.

Shelly Godfrey appeared in season 1's episode Six Degrees of Separation. She was a Number Six who was in Galactica after the Cylon attack. She accused Baltar of treason, by sabotaging human defenses, and therefore, being guilty of killing several millions of humans in that attack. She also appears in Battlestar Galactica: The Plan TV movie, which details a bit more her presence (and fate) aboard Galactica.

Another Number Six, Gina, acted as a contractor for the Battlestar Pegasus and was in a relationship with Admiral Cain. When Cain discovered that Gina was a Cylon agent, she ordered her crew to &quot;push her programming&quot; in an attempt to see if Gina was vulnerable to emotional trauma. Gina later escaped with Baltar's aid, assassinated Cain, and founded a resistance group in the fleet, preaching peace with the Cylons. While it seemed that Gina may have developed feelings for Baltar and was going to pursue a relationship with him, she detonated a nuclear warhead (provided by Baltar) which destroyed Cloud Nine, some other fleet ships, and generated an electromagnetic signature, the detection of which ultimately led the Cylon fleet to the new human colony on New Caprica.

A reincarnation of Baltar's Six (named Caprica Six by the others) committed the first incident of Cylon-on-Cylon violence in their history killing a Number Three with a rock in order to save the life of Samuel Anders, who himself was later discovered to be a Cylon.

With Caprica Six imprisoned on Galactica after helping a Sharon (Athena) (Number Eight) escape from the Cylons with Hera, she offered to testify against Dr. Baltar. While in the brig, she has a relationship with Saul Tigh that results in the first Cylon-Cylon pregnancy.

It should also be noted that Caprica Six has a &quot;Head Baltar&quot; which only she sees similar to how Baltar has a &quot;Head Six&quot; that only he can see; Head Baltar serves as a sort of conscience for Caprica Six, but also an advisor in times of trouble or danger, much the same role that Head Six plays for Baltar. This Head Baltar, has also appeared at least once to Baltar himself. Before the true nature of both Head Baltar and Head Six was revealed, there had been rampant speculation that Baltar was a Cylon. In the series finale, both Head Baltar and Head Six turned out to be divine beings (actually referred to as &quot;Angels&quot;) manipulating both the Colonials and Cylons into fulfilling &quot;God's plan&quot;.

Other important Sixes include Natalie, who originally led the rebel Cylon faction against Cavil's faction before being killed by Sharon Agathon in a misunderstanding, and Sonja, who was elected to represent the rebel Cylons in the Colonial fleet's Quorum of Ships' Captains.

Number Sixes are played by Tricia Helfer.{{Quote|Life has a melody, Gaius. A rhythm of notes which become your existence once played in harmony with God's Plan.|Inner Six to Gaius.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36123">'''Gaius Baltar''' is a character in the [[Battlestar Galactica]] series.

==Biography==
===Early life===
'''Gaius Baltar''' claims to be from the colony of Aerelon, a largely agricultural world that was known as the &quot;food basket for the twelve worlds.&quot; He was born and raised on a dairy farm outside of the town of Cuffle's Breath Wash. At the age of ten, finding the Aerelon dialect (demonstrated by James Callis to be a coarse Yorkshire accent) to be detrimental to his career dreams, he trained himself to speak with a Caprican dialect (refined English, Callis' usual Received Pronunciation) in hopes that one day he might be considered a citizen of one of the more respected and wealthy colonies, Caprica specifically. This implies that a number of colonies (for example Sagittaron and Gemenon) are not only poor worlds, but also viewed as intellectual and cultural backwaters. According to his account, Baltar left Aerelon after his 18th birthday.

Baltar eventually became a brilliant computer scientist and an important defense researcher on Caprica, and a personal friend to President Richard Adar. He was perhaps best known for his controversial views on research into Strong AI, saying in an interview: &quot;The ban on research and development into artificial intelligence is, as we all know, a hold-over from the Cylon Wars. Quite frankly, I find this to be an outmoded concept; it serves no useful purpose except to impede our efforts.&quot;

===The Destruction of the Twelve Colonies===
At the onset of the miniseries, he is involved in an intense sexual relationship with a beautiful blonde woman. Believing her to be working for a corporation in the defense industry, and desiring a more permanent relationship with her, he gives her access to the Colonial defense mainframe so her employers can have an advantage in future contract bidding. In exchange for his access to government mainframes she helps him design a navigation program used by Colonial warships, covertly creating backdoors in the program. When the Cylons attack, they are able to penetrate software security firewalls, disabling entire fighter squadrons outright and sabotaging vital capital-ship systems. On the day the Cylons attack humanity, she reveals that she is an advanced Cylon (known as Number Six) and that she used the information given to her to shut down the Colonial defenses.

Having unintentionally brought about the near-annihilation of the human species, Baltar flees Caprica when Karl Agathon gives up his place on a Raptor, feeling that his own life is less important to save than a famed scientist's. The Raptor returns to the Battlestar Galactica, where Baltar endears himself to Laura Roslin, the new President of the remnants of the Twelve Colonies, and hopes to conceal his involvement in the genocide that has taken place.

===Scientist for the Fleet===
Once a part of the fleet, Baltar is haunted by visions of Number Six, with whom he converses often. It is unknown whether these projections are from a chip that Number Six implanted in Baltar's brain while they were together on Caprica (the explanation originally given by the Number Six vision, which she later disclaimed) or if she is simply a manifestation of Baltar's own mind. Although the vision of Number Six manipulates Baltar through his fear of discovery, she lends him an edge by granting him unique knowledge and helps him overcome weaknesses in his personality.

The model of Number Six who had seduced him on Caprica later experiences similar visions after her consciousness was downloaded into a new body. Whereas Baltar experienced visions of her, she experienced visions of him. Both visions acted in similar ways: they were seemingly crueler than the person they were based on and often manipulated the affected party against his or her own species.

Shortly after Baltar comes on board Galactica, his Internal Six reveals that a device has been put in the CIC that he had previously seen in possession of Six on Caprica. Six tells him that it wasn't her job to put it in the CIC. Baltar realizes that there is a Cylon on board Galactica, but knows he cannot reveal that information, or indicate that the device is not a part of the ship without implicating himself in the destruction of the Colonies. Baltar decides to implicate a person on board who goes by Aaron Doral because he is a civilian who has had access to the CIC during the last several weeks and, as an outsider, would be more likely to be untrusted by the Galactica crew. Having already been put in charge of testing the fleet for Cylons, Baltar informs the Executive Officer that he discreetly collected hair samples of crew members and has found that Doral is a Cylon. Baltar, however, had no method at the time for testing for Cylons in the fleet. Baltar also explains that he saw Doral doing something with a strange looking device in the CIC that he does not recognize. With this (Doral is, it turns out, indeed a Cylon), Baltar is able to protect not only the fleet, but his own interests as well.

Unfortunately for Baltar, this forces him to develop an actual method for testing the fleet for Cylons, having already 'demonstrated' an ability to do so. The process he eventually creates is reliable and is done through the testing of blood samples, but is time consuming (it takes 11 hours to test one person). This meant that it would take 61 years to test the entire fleet, and makes Baltar feel his work is of little importance.

In the episode &quot;Six Degrees of Separation,&quot; Baltar is accused of being a traitor to the human race when a flesh-and-blood Number Six (after Baltar and his Internal Six have a heated argument over whether or not God exists) shows photographic evidence that Baltar carried an explosive device into the Colonial Defense Mainframe on Caprica, allowing the Cylons to carry out their nuclear attack. When it is found that the evidence is faked, President Roslin holds a press conference publicly exonerating Baltar. Internal Six tells him that his public position is now stronger than ever since he has been accused of a serious crime and found innocent, and even possibly been the target of a Cylon plot. Meanwhile, the real-life Six disappears from Galactica and is nowhere to be found.

In the episode &quot;The Hand of God,&quot; Baltar successfully helps the fleet destroy a Cylon mining base on an asteroid with badly needed tylium ores for fueling the fleet. Because the base could not be nuked (as the radiation would render the ores inert), the best plan for the attack was to destroy the part of the base holding the volatile unrefined tylium precursor (in order to create a large explosion). The planners of the attack ask Baltar to point out where it is on a recon photo, even though he has no idea what it looks like. In his mind, Baltar asks his Internal Six for help, but she tells him it is in God's hands and He will 'tell' Baltar where to point. Baltar then points to one of the buildings of the base, simply as a wild guess (though he doesn't tell the others that). Baltar is terrified, telling Six he didn't hear God's voice, but she reassures him that &quot;God doesn't always speak in words.&quot; Much to Baltar's surprise, his wild guess at which building held the volatile tylium precursor was correct. Baltar then realizes that the only logical explanation may be that God truly did guide his hand.

===Vice Presidency===
In the episode &quot;Colonial Day,&quot; Baltar demonstrates surprising charisma when he attacks vice presidential-hopeful Tom Zarek on behalf of the President while being interviewed by the fleet's media. This, coupled with Baltar's newfound fame from being falsely accused of treason, convinces Roslin to choose Baltar as her vice president over a previous choice. In the end, Baltar defeats Zarek in their race for the Vice Presidency.

In the second season episode &quot;Home, Part II,&quot; Baltar undergoes a brain scan similar to an MRI which reveals no sign of a computer chip or any other foreign object in his brain. While this briefly leads him to think that he had truly gone insane, he then realizes that the vision of Number Six he sees could not possibly be a hallucination generated by his subconscious mind, because she is aware of facts that his own mind could not possibly know. Number Six tells him that the first Human/Cylon Hybrid will be born in the ship's brig, and soon after the Caprican version of the Cylon Sharon Valerii (pregnant with the human Karl Agathon's child) is imprisoned in it. When Baltar confronts Six with this, she states that she was neither a computer chip nor a hallucination. When Baltar then asks just who or what she is, she simply replies that she is &quot;an angel of God sent here to protect you, to guide you, and to love you.&quot;

Baltar's relationship with Six was further complicated by the appearance of Gina, another Six copy who had been posing as a maintenance worker on the Battlestar Pegasus. After discovering Gina, who had been repeatedly tortured and raped by Pegasus crewmembers, Baltar grows fond of her, making the illusory Six jealous. He eventually helps Gina escape from the Pegasus and arranges a place for her safety. Gina later forms a pacifist movement within the fleet, though it is noteworthy their methods are not always peaceful, and Baltar is initially reluctant to support the organization despite his affections for her. Later, however, after saving President Roslin from terminal cancer, he reads the letter she had left for him to be opened upon her death (a custom performed by all presidents, written to their successors upon their leaving office) which states he has a &quot;selfish nature&quot; and asks that he overcome it for the well-being of the fleet. Afterwards, Baltar's vision of Number Six persuades him to give Gina and the movement a nuclear bomb Admiral William Adama afforded him in an earlier episode to test the fleet for Cylons.

Having been offended by Roslin's letter, and encouraged by outspoken Roslin-critic (and Baltar's former opponent in the race for Vice President) Tom Zarek, Baltar announces his intention to run against incumbent Laura Roslin for the presidency with the next election approaching. He does this by surprising both her and the press at a press conference after Roslin's announcement of a moratorium on abortion. Baltar hijacks the conference, establishing himself as a candidate and secular alternative to the molded prophet-like image of Roslin.

===Run for the Presidency===
Baltar, with Zarek as his close political advisor, proceeds to run a bitterly contentious campaign against Roslin. He is far behind Roslin in the polls during most of the election and is able to make limited progress only by painting her as a dangerous religious fundamentalist. With little time remaining before the election, a desolate but habitable planet is accidentally discovered in a region of space where heavy electromagnetic interference makes navigation and long-range observation very difficult. Baltar, although he has no personal desire to settle on the planet, announces that he will begin immediate civilian settlement of &quot;New Caprica&quot; if elected. With Roslin opposed to settlement on the planet, Baltar's popularity quickly rises. Fearing that she will lose the presidential race, Roslin holds a private meeting with Baltar, asking to deliver a joint statement of tabling the issue of colonization until after the election (which he rejects). Roslin then confronts Baltar on whether he was with a copy of Number Six on Caprica before the Cylon attack (At the height of her illness from cancer, Roslin had a flashback of an encounter between Baltar and Number Six prior to the Cylon attack, but was not able to fully process her memories at the time). Baltar avoids answering the question and leaves.

Due to his support for settlement of New Caprica, the election promptly swings in Baltar's favor and, after an attempted conspiracy to commit voting fraud fails to keep Roslin in power (organized by Roslin herself), he wins a narrow victory and is sworn in as president. Just prior to his inauguration, Baltar visits Gina, who makes love to him for the first time (she had previously refused physical intimacy, having suffered severe emotional and physical scarring from being repeatedly raped aboard the Pegasus). During the inauguration itself, she detonates the nuclear warhead that Baltar had given her, destroying the luxury liner Cloud 9 and killing herself in the process. Following this apparent act of Cylon nuclear terrorism, Admiral Adama urges Baltar to immediately focus on internal security and investigate how a Cylon agent could have carried out the bombing. Baltar refuses, however, and stubbornly proceeds with plans for settlement.

===Presidency on New Caprica===
Baltar remains in office for one year, but his feelings of guilt (or possibly just his fear of being discovered) regarding his involvement in both the fall of the colonies and Gina's suicide bombing, combined with the stress of the presidency and his inexperience in dealing with policy matters, have led him to substance abuse and womanizing, which he does not hide from his Chief of Staff Felix Gaeta. Life on New Caprica has turned out to be extremely difficult, with the civilian population living in extremely rough conditions, and with shortages of basic supplies like antibiotics persisting. In addition, Baltar's government is in the midst of a major labor dispute with a union led by Galen Tyrol, who is advocating a strike for workers' rights. Baltar indicates to Gaeta that he may be willing to jail union organizers if the labor disputes continue.

The political difficulties faced by Baltar's administration are soon made irrelevant, however, when a Cylon fleet arrives in orbit of New Caprica. The remaining military fleet, which has been operating using skeleton crews, jumps away, leaving New Caprica to be occupied by the Cylons. A Cylon delegation, which includes the reborn versions of both the Number Six who had originally seduced Baltar (now known by the other Cylons as Caprica-Six) and the Sharon Valerii who was originally stationed on Galactica, lands in the human settlement and accepts Baltar's surrender. When Baltar asks how the Cylons managed to detect New Caprica, it is revealed that they were a light-year away when they detected the light and radiation from the nuclear explosion Gina set off the year before. Baltar has thus once again inadvertently aided the Cylons in their subjugation of humanity.

Baltar continues to hold the office of the Presidency, but only as a figurehead. 133 days after the Cylons land on New Caprica, a Doral model Cylon states that most humans have come to consider Baltar a traitor and would rejoice in his death. Compounding his alienation to his people, he was forced at gunpoint to sign an execution order for hundreds of humans. However, throughout the occupation of New Caprica, Baltar tried to persuade the Cylons that their mission to rule over the human race could not succeed and that they should leave the planet. Before he evacuates the planet with Caprica-Six, Baltar reveals he has been having suicidal thoughts.

As the Colonials evacuate New Caprica, Baltar and Caprica-Six discover Hera, the child of Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon whom Six predicted would be born in Galactica's Brig. Roslin, it turns out, had hidden Hera's existence by falsifying her death and secretly allowing a young mother to adopt the child as her own.

===Life Among the Cylons===
In the episode &quot;Collaborators,&quot; we find Baltar living on a Cylon Basestar in a barless cell furnished with only a bed, a table, and a bathrobe, guarded by a Centurion. It is here that Caprica-Six tells Baltar that she has had a change of heart about him and has let her feelings for him cloud her judgment, presumably ending their relationship. However, by the end of the episode, it is indicated that she has cast the tie-breaking vote amongst the Cylons to allow Baltar to remain alive aboard the Cylon Basestar, though it is clear they remain estranged.

Over time, Baltar becomes accustomed to his new environment. Once Baltar learns that no one knows what the &quot;Final Five&quot; Cylons look like, he begins to suspect that he himself may be a Cylon. He admits however that this is wishful thinking on his part, because of his desire to have all his 'sins' forgiven and become a hero to another people, rather than be a scourge to his own.

Shortly after he begins living with the Cylons, Baltar is allowed to investigate a stricken Basestar that had fallen afoul of a disease because of his supposed immunity. Baltar is adamant about doing this because he is desperate to prove his loyalty to the Cylons and avoid death, though he requires convincing from his internal version of Six. Once Baltar is on board the Basestar, he finds the origin of the disease—an ancient human probe. Baltar chooses not to tell the Cylons about the probe, in fear that it will implicate him in the spreading of the disease (the Basestar went to its location only because Baltar directed it there to aid the Cylons in their search for Earth). Once the probe is discovered by the Cylons, Baltar is tortured by a highly suspicious Three model known as D'Anna Biers, who uses a set of metal leads covering two fingers on his left hand, creating intense pain with no actual physical damage. During his torture, Baltar is able to induce some form of spiritual epiphany in D'Anna with the help of his Internal Six, and is let go after apparently declaring his love for D'Anna while staring at his vision of Six. He subsequently had repeated ménage à trois with both D'Anna and Caprica-Six (indicating she and Baltar re-formed their relationship).

Towards the end of Baltar's stay with the Cylons, he grows much closer to D'Anna, who has become obsessed with finding the identities of the &quot;Final Five&quot; Cylons. Pondering if he himself is a Cylon, Baltar brushes Caprica-Six aside and aligns with D'Anna. Together, in the episodes &quot;Eye of Jupiter&quot; and &quot;Rapture,&quot; Baltar and the Three models defy the other Cylon models and he and D'Anna travel to the surface of an algae planet in search for an ancient ruined temple. Three believed the temple would show her the identities of the Final Five. D'Anna appears to see the Final Five, but collapses and swiftly dies before she can tell Baltar if he is a Cylon or not. She does however say &quot;You were right,&quot; possibly indicating that Baltar is in fact a Cylon, though it is unclear what she was referring to. Hoping to retrigger the vision, Baltar steps onto the platform that D'Anna used, when Chief Tyrol gets the drop on Baltar and knocks him out. The ex-president is then transported back to Galactica in a body bag and sent to the brig. Baltar and Caprica-Six re-establish their relationship later in the series because she took refuge with the Colonial Fleet after helping Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon retrieve her child, though the two are unable to meet in person as she is imprisoned on Galactica.

===Trial===
Following a failed suicide attempt in his cell, Baltar is threatened with death from President Roslin (though she is actually bluffing). Roslin orders Colonel Tigh to throw Baltar out of one of Galactica's airlocks, while repeatedly demanding whether he even knew any of the people who died during his presidency. After pointing out a man along the Galactica's memorial wall (a former lab aide of Baltar's) and reciting almost encyclopedic knowledge of the man, Roslin allows Baltar to be returned to his cell. He is then subjected to a radical form of hallucinogen-based interrogation by Admiral Adama, who convinces Baltar that he is drowning, and that Adama will only save him in return for information. However, Baltar does not have much useful information for Adama. In the course of his interrogation, Baltar admits his unwitting complicity in the original Cylon attack on the Colonies, though without any specifics. Because his admission was extracted through illegal proceedings, this information could not be submitted at a trial. Felix Gaeta is then drafted to offer Baltar the possibility of escaping execution and getting better treatment in exchange for cooperation, as Adama, Tigh and Roslin seek to learn any clues to Earth's location that the Cylons may have obtained from the Temple. Baltar reveals that he has some hold over Felix Gaeta, as he assures Gaeta that his personal demons will be &quot;our little secret&quot; (it is unknown what Baltar was referring to, if anything), shortly before Gaeta stabs Baltar in the neck with a fountain pen (narrowly missing the carotid artery, which would have killed Baltar). Throughout these events, Baltar repeatedly demands a fair trial. Roslin finally decides to reject Adama's suggestion that Baltar be made to &quot;simply disappear&quot; and orders him to be given a trial for his crimes, even after a warning from Tom Zarek (now Vice President) that doing so will provoke dangerous unrest among the fleet's civilian and military populations alike.

Meanwhile, Baltar smuggles writings out of his cell through his lawyer, which are published in a memoir, My Triumphs, My Mistakes. In the book, Baltar attempts to explain his actions as President to the public and foment class warfare by describing the fleet as a bifurcated society, accusing the elite upper class of militarism and professional civilians of exploiting the less well-educated working class. While the book is not completed at the end of Season 3 (President Roslin confiscates several sections through repeated searches of Baltar's cell), it becomes very popular among certain segments of the fleet populace (despite Roslin's repeated attempts to suppress its distribution), including workers on the tylium refinery ship and Chief Tyrol's flight-deck maintenance crew, as well as his wife Cally Tyrol. The book's popularity leads to Tyrol calling a general strike and exacerbates the fleet's already strained social order. This development is ironic due to the labor difficulties Baltar experienced with Tyrol on New Caprica.

As his trial proceeds, Baltar's first lawyer is killed in an explosion aboard a sabotaged Raptor. His second attorney, Romo Lampkin, survives a similar attempt on his life. Lee Adama (now Lampkin's security adjutant) then joins Baltar's defense team. Following Lampkin's questioning of Saul Tigh, Lee has a falling out with father and resigns his military commission.

The trial is unfair, and includes witness Felix Gaeta deliberately lying to ensure a guilty verdict (though Felix may have done so to see Baltar dead before his secret could be revealed). Throughout the trial, the defense deals devastating blows to the prosecution's witnesses, but this only further exacerbates the existing hatred of Baltar in the courtroom. Baltar rejects his defense team's suggestion to demand a mistrial saying, &quot;there will be a verdict.&quot; Later, in the days preceding the conclusion of his trial, Baltar is informed by Caprica-Six via Lampkin that President Roslin has discussed her chamalla-induced religious visions with her and Athena.

The defense team uses the very end of the trial to try and persuade the jury (with a passionate testimony of Lee Adama) that Baltar is guilty merely of being a scapegoat for the Cylon occupation. In other words, whatever mistakes he had made as President, he is not guilty of treason. Lee Adama also mentions that the fleet has forgiven numerous other persons for their mistakes because they have had to in order to ensure their survival, and that Baltar is on trial only because he has become a symbol of the pain and guilt that many still feel about what happened on New Caprica. The argument is successful and Baltar is found not guilty for his crimes by a 3-2 vote, with Admiral Adama casting a vote in Baltar's favor. Roslin is disgusted that Baltar is now free as she still truly believes that Baltar was involved in sabotaging the colonial defenses in the attack. After Baltar is freed from prison, his defense team abandons him. Baltar realizes that despite his victories, he has neither a home nor any friends, and is alone among a fleet that overwhelmingly hates him.

===Return to Civilian Life===
Fortunately for Baltar, shortly before the Cylon fleet attacks at the Ionian Nebula, Baltar is led away to safety by three female followers of his work, one of whom had asked him to bless her sick child before his trial. He is received warmly by a group (with mostly female members) that has erected a shrine to him in an unused compartment of Galactica. Baltar quickly learns that he has no other place to go, and must stay on the ship. As the others leave, one of the young women stays behind with Baltar; she is fascinated by the way he appears to be praying with his hands clasped (although Baltar is really responding to his Internal Six). The woman tells Baltar that she feels her prayers to the Lords of Kobol have not been heard. At the suggestion of Six, Baltar convinces the woman that there is only one God. The young woman is overjoyed to hear this and the two make love. Shortly afterwards, the woman who came to Baltar in his prison cell earlier, returns from the infirmary with her son who is very sick and near death. Once the cult members go to sleep Baltar prays softly to God to spare the child's life and take his instead. However, the child's mother and a few other women are still awake and overhear the prayer.

While in a public restroom (Baltar wanted a shave), he and another woman from the cult are later ambushed by two men, one of whom is Charlie Connor (featured in the episode &quot;Collaborators&quot; as the member of The Circle who pushes the button that executes Jammer), who noticed Baltar being led to his new home earlier in the episode. Connor blames Baltar for his own son's death on New Caprica. As he holds a razor to Baltar's throat, Internal Six asks him if he was serious about dying to save the sick child. Baltar reiterates his desire to die in the sick child's place. Connor is suddenly stunned and the woman from the cult then overcomes and incapacitates (probably killing) both assailants. Afterwards, she claims God gave her the strength she needed. Upon returning to the sick child, Baltar finds he has been miraculously cured, with no trace of a fever.

Shortly thereafter, Tory Foster (President Roslin's chief aide) is sent by the other revealed &quot;Final Five&quot; Cylons to seduce Baltar and learn if he knows the identity of the last of the Final Five. While eating in a mess hall on Galactica (with the door being guarded by two male followers of the new Monotheism religion), Baltar sees Foster is present and easily deduces that she is spying on him (believing she is doing so on orders from Laura Roslin). While the two begin to converse, Baltar sees a vision of himself (probably the same vision that Caprica-Six sees). At first, Baltar is shocked, but his Internal Self tells him to focus on Foster because she may be a good source of information. Foster tells Baltar she believes he is the center of recent miracles (the healed child and the fact that Kara Thrace returned shortly after the conclusion of his trial). Baltar says God must have chosen him to &quot;sing his song.&quot; Because Foster and the other Final Five became aware that they were Cylons through a mysterious song, she is dumbfounded by Baltar's eerily similar description of how God's plan is like an orchestra tuning up until their notes &quot;slide into place.&quot; As a result, she becomes anxious and promptly leaves. Baltar then begins to question his Internal Self as to his identity. The Virtual Baltar tells the real Baltar that he is not Internal Six and then changes the subject to Foster. The two agree that Baltar should see her again. Later, Foster and Baltar have sex. Afterward, Tory says she could be a Cylon, but Baltar tells her not to be afraid and that he has learned from his time among them that Cylons have feelings. He says that humans may have made the Cylons, but it was the one true God that gave them souls.

===Monotheist Prophet===
After his following on Galactica is attacked by a polytheist group, Baltar (with the encouragement of his Internal Six) disrupts a religious ceremony of one of the polytheist denominations in the fleet. Later, President Roslin meets with the imprisoned Baltar to pressure him to avoid stirring up more trouble in the future. After he is released, Baltar is prevented from returning to his home by government soldiers acting under new legislation approved by the President. The legislation restricts the right to assembly specifically for Baltar's movement. Under the direction of Internal Six, Baltar keeps attempting to re-enter his home, and is subjected to repeated blows from a Galactica marine. Internal Six is shown physically lifting Baltar from the floor to a standing position; whereby camera pans across a couple views to allude to Baltar's view of the action and then the view of this action in the context of everyone else present. While we see Baltar's perspective, everyone else only sees a limp Baltar rising to a vertical posture. Their facial expressions appear to allude some sort of supernatural experience is occurring. This event continues until Lee Adama arrives to inform Baltar that the Quorum of Twelve has overruled the President and revoked the new legislation. Baltar goes on to preach that God loves all humans regardless of their sin because everyone is perfect just as they are. Foster is present at the speech and now appears to be a firm supporter of Baltar and his religion.

Baltar's religious speeches are eventually illegally broadcasted to the fleet and his following gradually grows larger and larger. Baltar's sermons include the importance of forgiveness and looking towards the future instead of the past. On Galactica, Tyrol attends another sermon by Baltar. When Tyrol tries to leave just as the sermon begins, Baltar calls on Tyrol to stay. Baltar tells Tyrol that he knows they've had differences, but that he should come and take his hand. When Tyrol does not respond, Baltar then says tells him that Cally (Tyrol's recently deceased wife) would have wanted him to take his hand. Tyrol decides to choke Baltar and furiously shouts that Baltar knew nothing about Cally just as Baltar's followers force him to leave. Later, against the warnings of his followers, Baltar pays a visit to Tyrol's quarters. Tyrol is present and Baltar nervously apologizes for his presumption about Cally and admits that he barely knew her. Baltar then attempts to commiserate with Tyrol about how hard it is to &quot;make sense of things sometimes,&quot; but says that he knows there is a purpose to everything that happens. Baltar then admits to having done heinous crimes in the past and says he feels his sermons are his last chance at redemption (in order to provide context for why he got carried away earlier). Finally, Baltar says he is truly sorry for Tyrol's loss and that he wished he had known her better. As Baltar starts to leave, Tyrol holds out his hand in friendship and Baltar eagerly accepts it.

===Abduction by Cylon Hybrid===
Shortly thereafter, Kara Thrace informs the once again cancer-stricken President Roslin that the Cylon Hybrid on the captured rebel Cylon Basestar referred to a &quot;dying leader&quot; learning the &quot;truth of the opera house&quot;--the setting of the dreams Roslin shares with Caprica-Six and Athena. As Baltar's popularity continued to increase, he choose to inform the fleet of Roslin sharing her visions with both of the long-time Cylons in the fleet. Although this development distressed Roslin, she decides to bring Baltar with her (along with Karl Agathon—Athena's husband) to the Cylon Basestar to see the Hybrid. She informs Baltar that she chose to do this because she sees him in the dreams she shares with Caprica-Six and Athena. The Basestar jumps away from the fleet the moment the Hybrid is reactivated to begin a series of jumps to reach the Cylon Resurrection Hub, leaving Baltar once again away from the fleet aboard a Cylon ship. When the Basestar jumps away from the Colonial Fleet, Roslin begins to have a series of visions involving Elosha, a deceased priestess. The visions continue to develop with each jump.

Baltar and Roslin attempt to interrogate the Hybrid, provoking it to yield cryptic fragments of information. Later, during an attack on the Cylon Resurrection Hub, Baltar initiates an intriguing dialogue with his Centurion guard. Baltar attempts to proselytize his monotheistic ideas, and while the Centurion's reactions are open to interpretation, it appears that some impact is made. However, the Centurion is destroyed while partially shielding Baltar from an explosion that injures him severely.

Baltar is then taken under the care of Roslin. After he is influenced by morpha administered by Roslin, Baltar reveals the details of his involvement in the attack on the Colonies. Roslin decides to kill Baltar by leaving no pressure on his wounds. Baltar pleads to Roslin not to kill him, but he is ignored. At that moment, the Basestar jumps again and Roslin's continuing vision of Elosha on Galactica culminates in an extended discourse on the need to respect the rights of the living, even the despised. Afterwards, Roslin panics and tries desperately to save Baltar's life, acting as if he were a close friend. Baltar recovers and is then reunited with the freed D'Anna. Later, Baltar thanks Roslin for choosing not to murder him.

===Arrival at Earth===
When the Basestar arrives at the Colonial Fleet, D'Anna assumes command and holds all Humans on board hostage. Roslin decides to try to convince D'Anna to stand down, but allows Baltar to go instead at his suggestion. Baltar convinces D'Anna to abandon another failed attempt at 'brute force' (referring to the events on New Caprica and the Algae Planet) and she cooperates with Interim-President Lee Adama. With the route to Earth now revealed by four of the Final Five Cylons via Kara Thrace's Viper, the combined fleet of Humans and Cylons arrives at Earth (with Baltar among the first to land on the planet). He and others are shocked to find Earth is a radioactive wasteland with many ruinous cities (suggesting a great civilization once lived there). The identity of the fifth and final Cylon model has now been revealed to be Ellen Tigh, Colonel Saul Tigh's &quot;deceased&quot; wife.

==Personality and characteristics==
Gaius Baltar's character and outlook change dramatically throughout the series, though many things about him remain constant. Baltar is a habitual womanizer and rarely turns down an opportunity to seduce someone. He is narcissistic and has a well-developed acting talent, which he uses to spin yarns on virtually any subject when he feels the need to. Almost without exception, his attempts at manipulation are accepted at face value due to his educational background, intelligence and considerable personal charisma. However, he is sometimes exceptionally compassionate towards others and altruistic, willing to sacrifice for the good of others (especially towards the end of the series). In the final season of the series, Baltar expresses regret for having been a &quot;profoundly selfish man&quot; and that his work as a spiritual leader is his &quot;last chance at redemption.&quot;

When the series began, Baltar was either an atheist or an agnostic, but begins to consider the existence of God to be a possibility due to the events in the first season episode &quot;The Hand of God.&quot; Though he appears less certain about the existence of God in the fourth season episode &quot;He That Believeth in Me,&quot; he still prays to God to take his life in the place of a sick child. Later, the child is suddenly healed. This, as well as his miraculous escape from sudden death when Internal Six asks if his prayer was sincere, and her insistence that he spread monotheistic beliefs, turn him into a monotheist. His statements in the episode &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; suggest that his monotheistic beliefs are more specifically panentheism.

'''Lee Joseph &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama''' is a former Colonial Fleet Reserve officer who became the [[Caprica|Caprican]] delegate to the Quorum of Twelve, then later the interim President of the Twelve Colonies of [[Kobol]]. He is the sole surviving son of [[William Adama]].

==Biography==
Lee was born and raised on Caprica. A headstrong scrappy boy, he was forever getting into fights at school with much bigger kids and usually coming away with the better of the encounter.

His parents divorced when he was eight years old and he and his younger brother, [[Zak Adama|Zak]], were raised by their mother. Their father visited when he could, but the military life often took him away for long months at a time and Lee and Zak grew up with only snapshot memories of their father. Nevertheless, both boys grew up worshiping the distant man who periodically showed up at the house in his blue uniform with a big smile and a toy bought in some exotic port.

Despite his mother's misgivings, Lee always wanted to be a pilot, to follow in his father's footsteps and join the Fleet. He studied hard in school, aced his entrance exams to the Academy and graduated number three in his class. He was immediately accepted into flight school and again quickly rose to the top of his class. His superiors marked him down early as a young man on the rise, an officer destined for the top commands and eventually the Admiralty itself. It was about this time that Lee and his father began to have a falling out. The boy's hero worship had turned into the young man's resentments at being abandoned and neither he nor his father knew how to bridge the gap and so the visits became rare and the phone calls grew tarse.

While Lee was at flight school, his younger brother Zak was just entering the Academy. Zak had a tougher time of it than Lee, constantly falling behind in his studies, always on report for some infraction of the rules, forever one step away from being bounced out.

Lee took top honors at flight school and soon was on his way into a [[Viper]] squadron and a plum assignment on the Atlantia - flagship of the fleet. Meanwhile, Zak barely graduated from the Academy and when he still wanted to go to flight school, Lee tried to dissuade him from even applying. Lee loved his brother, would do anything for him, but it was obvious to Lee that Zak wasn't really cut out for the military life, much less the rigors of flight training. The only reason Zak even applied to the Academy was because he worshiped the ground their father walked on - as Lee himself once did. Lee tried to convince Zak to seek another job in the fleet, but Zak wouldn't hear of it; he wasn't going to be the only Adama without wings on his uniform.

Zak's application was turned down and that seemed to be the end of it, but then a phone call was placed to the flight commandant from Commander Adams and place suddenly opened up for Zak. Lee was furious, couldn't believe his father would pull strings like this, but there was nothing he could do but hope for the best and continue to encourage Zak in his training. Then came yet another shock - Zak wrote Lee to tell him he was engaged to one of his instructors at flight school.

Lee made time to come visit and it was then that he met [[Kara Thrace]] for the first time. She was the polar opposite of Zak - where he was quiet, reserved, almost painfully sensitive, she was brash, loud, and had a thick hide. Lee liked her immediately. He was pretty sure that she felt the same, but never seriously considered anything further. Lee wished them well and left to rejoin his squadron.

Two weeks later, Zak's plane went down while he was flying a routine solo mission and he was killed. Lee's resentments and grief boiled over at the funeral and he lashed out at his father, blaming him directly for his brother's death, saying in so many words that Adama had all but killed his own son. Father and son never spoke again.

Lee spent the next two years focusing on his career, having no personal life and working to become the perfect fighter pilot.

He applied, and was accepted, to test pilot school, the highest honor for any pilot and a sure sign of his rise to the top. He was at test pilot school when the orders came in to report aboard Galactica for her decommissioning ceremony.

==Personality and characteristics==
Lee Adama has his father's strength of character and a virtually inviolable code of ethics. He can be stubborn and difficult, often drives his pilots too hard and himself even harder. He rarely gives anyone a break and never gives himself one. From his mother, he's inherited a secret love of cooking and food, which he indulges whenever he can, the rigid pilot finding an out to let his creative juices flow only in a kitchen filled with steaming pots and pans.

He's a young man with a lot of anger, a lot of resentments and a lot of frustrations who knows not what to do with them. But he's also a fair and decent human being whose deeply felt sense of right and wrong have kept him afloat when so many around him have sunk. He's the kind of man few would call friend, but many would follow into the jaws of hell. He is his father's son.

[[Admiral]] '''Nagala''' was a flag officer serving in the [[Colonial Fleet]]. During the events surrounding the [[Cylon]]s surprise [[Fall of the Twelve Colonies|attack]] on the [[Twelve Colonies]], Nagala took personal command of the Fleet from the [[Battlestar]] ''[[Atlantia (Re-Imagined Series)|Atlantia]]'' following the destruction of [[Picon Fleet Headquarters]]. A subsequent assault saw Cylon forces destroy the Battlestar ''Atlantia'', resulting in Nagala's death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="990">The term &quot;'''Human'''&quot; (also known as &quot;Colonial&quot;) as it was used within the reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica'' series typically referred to a member of a sentient mammalian bipedal species originally from the planet Kobol. They were an outwardly indistinguishable from ''Homo sapiens'' extraterrestrial race with compatible DNA to ''Homo sapiens'' as a result of a parallel evolution of hominids on both Kobol and Earth. The Colonial humans were a Kobol-evolved ''Homo sapiens'' analogue.

There are no longer &quot;pure&quot; Kobol-evolved humans living, meaning that humanity, as it was defined by people in the Twelve Colonies of Kobol has gone extinct. The modern humans of Earth are a product of hybridization of them and the original indigenous native Earth-evolved ''Homo sapiens''.

A notable physiological distinction of Kobol-evolved humans from Earth-evolved humans was a lacking of a universal donor blood type—Type O Negative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2141">The '''Colonial religion''' is a polytheistic faith with a strong emphasis on the philosophy of eternal return. 

Most Colonials worship the Lords of Kobol: Zeus, father of the gods; Aphrodite, the goddess of love and sensuality; Ares, the god of war; and the rest of them. The colonists believe that the Lords ruled ancestral tribes on Kobol and delivered them to the Twelve Colonies over two thousand years ago. They also believe that service to the gods in life is rewarded with eternal salvation.

Faith in the gods touches every part of Colonial life. Nearly everyone prays to the Lords for guidance and support. Children are dedicated to one or two of the Lords at birth. Those gods are said to influence the child's talents, personality, and success. Services call upon the gods to lead the spirits of the dead from darkness and grant them immortality.

Religion is also central to colonial politics. Priests swear officials into office and serve as advisors. Prayers are part of debates and voting. The clergy is a bonafide government body and to some degree influences all the others.

Colonial faith is communal. Temples exist on every ship. Some are specific to certain Lords or beliefs. Others are open to all. Visitors can pray alone but the group is always there. Examples of the community are everywhere. Faith groups shepherd each other through the pain of the colonies' destruction. Before facing their enemies, soldiers break a salt line and pray together. Even the ultimate expression of faith is communal: &quot;So say we all.&quot;

Believers are tended by two types of clergy. Priests are the Lords' foot soldiers. They keep temples, perform services, and care for the faithful. Oracles perform all functions of priests, but most believe they're something more. They've given themselves over entirely to the gods and claim to receive many gifts in return. Believers say oracles can see the future.

Oracles sometimes take chamalla, the extract of a bitter-tasting root that provokes hallucinations. Skeptics say the oracles' visions are just random hallucinations, but all too often, the visions come true.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7971">Battlestar Galactica (2004)


Battlestar Pegasus first appears in the re-imagined series episode &quot;[[Pegasus]]&quot; and remains part of the series from then until the episode &quot;[[Exodus, Part 2]]&quot;, playing a major role in the episodes &quot;Resurrection Ship&quot; and &quot;[[The Captain's Hand]]&quot;.

Battlestar Pegasus is a Mercury Class Battlestar, assigned to Battlestar Group 62 of the Colonial Fleet, and commanded by Admiral Helena Cain at the time of the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies. Thought to have been destroyed during the attack, Pegasus escaped, and encounters Battlestar Galactica and the last survivors of the Twelve Colonies around six months after their escape from Ragnar Anchorage.

Before the fall of the Twelve Colonies, Pegasus had just docked at [[Scorpion Fleet Shipyards]] where it was due for a three-month overhaul. Many of the ship's systems were offline, including the Command Navigation Program the Cylons used to disable Colonial defences during their attack. The Cylons' opening wave hit the shipyard with several nuclear warheads, destroying five ships, including two Battlestars. Pegasus lost over 700 crew members, but survived the attack by performing a blind FTL jump. This blind jump resulted in the ship escaping immediate destruction, but risked the battlestar's possible reappearance inside a star or planetary atmosphere.

As a result of the Cylons' devastating attack on the Twelve Colonies, Admiral Cain became increasingly iron-fisted. Pegasus's Executive Officer, Colonel Jack Fisk, recalls to his Galactica counterpart, Colonel Tigh, of an incident in which Admiral Cain shot the original XO in the head in front of the crew for refusing to implement her order to attack a heavily-defended Cylon relay station. Fisk then burst into laughter, as if this claim were a joke. However, Tigh later tells Adama he is sure Fisk was telling the truth, and in Battlestar Galactica: Razor it is shown that Cain did indeed kill Belzen, replacing him with Fisk.

It is later revealed that Pegasus had encountered a small civilian refugee fleet, which Cain subsequently cannibalized for spare parts and supplies. She also press ganged civilians into her crew at gunpoint, which led to several families being murdered under Cain's orders. Eventually, she abandoned the fifteen ship fleet to fend for itself, without any FTL drives or critical supplies.

After Pegasus escaped from the shipyards, and before meeting Galactica, Pegasus had been performing repeated hit and run attacks upon Cylon forces. Pegasus had trailed a large Cylon fleet which jumped between systems with natural resources. In one of these jumps, Pegasus discovers the escaping fleet of Colonial ships protected by Galactica.

The initial rejoicing in the rag tag fleet following Pegasus's meeting with Galactica does not last long. As the senior surviving Colonial officer, Admiral Cain assumes command of the fleet, replacing Galactica's Commander William Adama. While at first assuring Adama that she would not interfere with Galactica's operations, Cain soon orders crew reassignments, withholds the delivery of supplies to the civilian fleet and sends her so-called &quot;Cylon interrogator&quot;, Lieutenant Thorne, to question Galactica's Cylon prisoner. Lt. Thorne's interrogation and attempted rape of the Cylon model known as Sharon results in his accidental death after he is interrupted and attacked by two of the Galactica's crew, Chief Petty Officer Galen Tyrol and Lieutenant Karl &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon, both of whom had had relationships with Cylon copies of Sharon.

Tyrol and Agathon are arrested by Pegasus Marines and charged with killing Lt. Thorne. Cain sentences both to death after a summary trial. Receiving the news of his men's death sentences, Commander Adama orders a strike team of Colonial Marines to be sent to Pegasus to retrieve his crewmen. An armed stand off between Pegasus and the ship's complement of Mark VII Vipers against Galactica's own Mark II and Mark VII Vipers ends when Lieutenant Starbuck reappears from her (unauthorized) recon mission aboard the stealth Blackbird with photos of a mysterious Cylon ship being guarded by two Basestars. Interrogation of Pegasus' Cylon prisoner (a Number Six model named Gina) reveals that the mysterious ship is a &quot;Resurrection Ship&quot;, a vessel that gives new bodies to dead Cylons, effectively making the Cylons fearless of death. Although Adama and Cain declare an uneasy truce in order to coordinate an attack on the Cylons, they make plans to assassinate each other, which are called off after the Resurrection Ship is destroyed. Gina escapes with the help of Baltar and kills Admiral Cain.

Colonel Jack Fisk is promoted and named Commander of Pegasus after Cain's death; he is murdered by members of a black market organization shortly thereafter. Chief Engineer Barry Garner replaces Commander Fisk as commander of Pegasus. Around this time, the two battlestars in the fleet become known as the Bucket (Galactica) and the Beast (Pegasus). Commander Garner, who is stated as an excellent engineer, but unused to command, allows Pegasus to be drawn into an ambush by three Cylon Basestars. Pegasus suffers damage to her FTL drive cooling system, thus preventing her from escaping with an FTL jump. Commander Garner, leaving the able Lee Adama to command Pegasus in the heat of the battle, sacrifices his life to repair the damage, allowing Pegasus to jump to safety.

Adama, promoted to Admiral after Cain's death, promotes his son, Major Lee Adama, to commander and gives him command of Battlestar Pegasus. As the first mission with its new commander, Pegasus is sent to search for a missing Raptor science team and comes under attack from a force of First Cylon War era fighters. Pegasus is unable to leave due to problems with its FTL drive, but quickly fixes the problems and leaves, but not before Kara Thrace shoots down an enemy fighter in the landing pod. Learning of the Guardians from Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon and the First Hybrid, Pegasus, accompanied by Admiral Adama (who was there when the First Hybrid was created) goes after the Guardian Basestar to destroy it and rescue the missing science crew. The mission is a success, with the Guardian Basestar and First Hybrid destroyed, but Pegasus' XO, Major Kendra Shaw, is killed destroying it. Soon after, the fleet discovers a habitable world and begins to colonize it naming it &quot;New Caprica&quot;. Pegasus and Galactica, with skeleton crews, form an orbital defense network over the new colony. However, when the colony is discovered a year later by a Cylon fleet they are forced to abandon the colony and jump away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Destruction

Pegasus is destroyed in action during the third-season episode &quot;[[Exodus, Part 2]]&quot;. Disobeying orders from Admiral Adama to protect the civilians that first escape the Cylon occupation in the second season episode &quot; Lay Down Your Burdens Part ll &quot;, Apollo leaves all of his Viper squadrons with the civilian ships, along with most of the crew. Apollo is able to divert the attention of the four Cylon Basestars attacking Galactica after FTL jumping to New Caprica. The older battlestar continues to cover the evacuation of the New Caprica colonists. This distraction allows time for Galactica's FTL drives to be repaired and the planet-bound colonists to reach their ships and escape.

One Cylon Basestar is critically damaged by Pegasus' forward main batteries as it enters the fray, drawing the fire from the Basestars. After Galactica jumps away, Pegasus (now heavily damaged and unable to escape) is locked into a suicide course, weapons systems firing automatically. The crew is evacuated to several Raptors just before Pegasus rams a Basestar, destroying it. The explosion causes the battlestar to fragment, the starboard hangar pod colliding with and destroying another Basestar.

      <comment>Fixed Troll Removing The Page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="789">Played by Bodie Olmos, the son of Edward James Olmos, Hot Dog was one of the pilots trained by Kara Thrace after the events of episode 4, season 1, &quot;Act of Contrition.&quot; In that episode, he opts to stay when Starbuck and the rest of the trainees are confronted by a flight of 8 raiders while on a training exercise.&amp;nbsp; While proving futile, and resulting in heavy damage to his viper, this act earns Hot Dog the respect of the rest of the squadron.



Hot Dog remains a consistent, albeit minor character throughout the series, and turns out to be the father of Cally's boy, Nicky, long thought to be sired by Chief Tyrol. This is revealed in &quot;A Disquiet Follows My Soul&quot; in season 4.5.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3847">'''Kobol''' is the birthplace and original home of humanity, from which the civilization departed and formed the [[Twelve Colonies]] on other worlds. According to legend, there was also a thirteenth tribe who settled on a &quot;lost&quot; colony, a planet called Earth, whose location remained a mystery to the populations of the other twelve.

==Kobol (Battlestar Galactica 1978 Series)==
Kobol is the ancestral homeworld of the people of the Twelve Colonies. Twelve of the tribes left to become the Twelve Colonies, the thirteenth tribe left to found Earth.

Kobol, when discovered by Galactica, is a desert planet, with Egyptian themed ruins. The [[Tomb of the Ninth Lord of Kobol]] is used by Adama to try to find Earth.

==Kobol (RDM)==
[[File:640px-Home pt1-Kobol.jpg|thumb]]
Kobol is the ancestral homeworld of the people of the Twelve Colonies, and one of two known planets where humans naturally evolved. Though it is a lush, life-supporting planet, Kobol has been uninhabited since the exodus of the Thirteen Tribes. On the surface, only ruins remain as evidence of the once-great civilization that previously existed.

Kobol appears to be a lush Earth-like planet with high mountains and dense forests. The details of its star system, however, have not been discussed. In contrast to the original series, Kobol's ruins appear to be more Greco-Roman analogous than Egyptian. In the final episode of the series, it is revealed that Kobol is one of two planets on which humans possibly evolved naturally (the other planet being our [[Earth]]).

Kobol has much of the same mythology of the original series. The thirteenth tribe is noted to have settled on a planet they named &quot;Earth&quot;, and there has been no contact between it and the other tribes, which are known as &quot;The Twelve Tribes of Kobol&quot;. It is later revealed that the thirteenth tribe is composed entirely of Cylons, meaning that the humans of Kobol had created the original humanoid Cylon race, the &quot;Final Five&quot; being the only apparent survivors of that race. The Cylon resurrection technology is also a rebuilt technology that existed on Kobol before its destruction.[citation needed]

Galactica discovers Kobol, but when it sends a survey team to its surface, their Colonial Raptor is shot down by a squadron of Cylon Raiders dispatched by a Basestar orbiting the planet. Galactica manages to destroy the Basestar, but there is evidence of a Cylon presence on the planet surface.

According to Colonial scriptures, humans lived on Kobol with their gods, the Lords of Kobol. An unspecified conflict spurred the humans of the time to flee Kobol on board the Galleon in the face of &quot;The Blaze&quot;. It was said that for any who return, Kobol would exact a price paid in blood.

Kobol is the location of the [[Tomb of Athena]], located near the [[Gates of Hera]]. An ancient relic, the [[Arrow of Apollo]], was required to gain entry to the temple ruin in which it is said clues could be found to finding the way to the thirteenth colony, Earth. Within the Tomb were statues representing each of the Twelve Tribes. When the arrow was placed on the statue representing Sagittarius, the location of Earth was revealed. Earth can see the twelve zodiac constellations which were imprinted on the original flags of the Twelve Colonies. Also, the Colonials recognized in the map a nebula that is visible to Earth; in reality, the Lagoon Nebula.

The Kobol opera house and forum, though a ruin in Galactica's time, was apparently once an important civic building on the planet. Five characters, human and Cylon, have experienced visions of the opera house in its original state thousands of years ago, the visions focusing on Hera Agathon or the final five Cylons

On a scouting mission, Galactica-Boomer and Crashdown discover a habitable planet. (Battlestar Galactica 2004 Series)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3233">[[File:Ftl3.jpg|thumb|Galactica's FTL drive]]
The '''FTL Drive''' is the propulsion system used by human and Cylon ships to achieve faster-than-light travel through space.  Prior to a jump, the drive is &quot;spooled up&quot; and then the ship &quot;jumps&quot; to another point in space.&lt;ref&gt;Miniseries&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==

The FTL Drive uses a dimensional transport effect.  The ships instantaneously teleport from one point in space to another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Season 1 (2004-05)]] DVD Producer Interviews&lt;/ref&gt; On human ships, the FTL Drives are powered by refined [[tylium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Hand of God]]&lt;/ref&gt; When a ship jumps, it distorts the space around it and can damage other vessels that are too close.  This can be seen in [[Someone to Watch Over Me]] when Boomer jumps away from the fleet just outside of Galactica's flight pod.  The spacial disruption tears holes in the outer hull of the ship, causing major damage to the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Someone to Watch Over Me]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navigation==

Navigation is very complex when using the FTLs.  Speed, trajectory and jump duration must be carefully calculated before a successful jump can be made.  Making a jump without these calculations, can take the ship into dangerous locations such as asteroid belts, singularities, or a planet's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lay Down Your Burdens, Part I]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly calculated jumps can be used to arrive in planetary orbit or to jump a formation of ships.  The latter is used most often by the Colonial fleet.  Jumping without calculations is possible.  It is known as a &quot;blind-jump&quot;.  Such a jump is made by Admiral [[Helena Cain]] as an effort to save her ship ([[Battlestar Pegasus (RDM)]]) from the [[Cylon]] attack on the [[Scorpion Fleet Shipyards]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pegasus]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jump coordinates must be updated constantly to account for ship movement and stellar drift.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scattered]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

Colonial ships have a jump limit known as the &quot;Red Line.&quot;  Any ship making a jump across this line risks unknown navigational hazards and possibly running off course due to compound errors in the calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Miniseries&lt;/ref&gt;

When going to disable the FTL during [[Felix Gaeta]]'s mutiny, [[Galen Tyrol]] notices some stress fractures and damage resulting from age and the number of jumps the ship has made.  He brings this to the attention of Admiral [[William Adama]] and repairs begin immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[[No Exit]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cylon technology==

[[Cylon]] ships are much capable of much more accurate jumps than the Colonials.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lay Down Your Burdens, Part I]]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also able to make much longer jumps than Colonial vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kobol's Last Gleaming, Part I]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a Cylon [[Heavy Raider]] can jump from the Fleet to [[Caprica]] in 10 jumps, whereas Galactica would need over 200.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lay Down Your Burdens, Part I]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cylon ships also use refined [[tylium]] as a fuel source for their ships.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Hand of God]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Rebel Basestar]] joins the fleet, they offer to upgrade the Colonial FTL Drives.  This work would be done entirely by Cylon work crews, but would potentially triple the Fleet's jump accuracy and distance.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Oath]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Caprica''' was an almost unhabitable planet, on which the [[Human|survivors]] of the [[Twelve Colonies]] had settled. After some time, when [[Cloud 9]] was destroyed, the [[Cylons]] found New Caprica and overthrew the colony.



New Caprica is a barely habitable planet in the midst of a nebula. It was briefly settled by humans of the refugee fleet of the Twelve Colonies. After a year, the Cylons discovered the settlement and dominated it for a few months. The human settlers on New Caprica built their new homes in a dry river bed near the equator; the planet's wet, damp, and dreary climate caused the river bed to turn to mud. Additionally, the damp and chilly climate led some colonists to develop flu and pneumonia type illnesses

==Description==
The history of the viper starfighter is a long and storied one in its nearly 55 year history it is one of the most enduring ancestries of ships of colonial history. Originally designed in Lionis as anti-pirate interceptor the Mk I possessed twin directed energy weapons these cannons had an nearly inexhaustible supply of ammunition as they where fed directly from the reactor core. Missiles could be mounted on the wings for additional assault capabilities. However due to it’s narrow form the avionics were extremely challenging with most cadets plowing into a planet rather than flying around in it. Another shortcoming was the booster system; Tylium injected directly into all three burner assemblies causing rapid boosts in acceleration however the trade off was that the reactor was eventually starved of fuel causing full system blackouts and causing the Mk I to be dead in the water.

[[File:Viper_Mk_III.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Mark III Viper]]
==Overview==
Some thought that the Mk III (cobra) was a masterpiece of engineering. Others; unnecessarily complicated. The Mk III had six engines instead of three. The thought was that several engines could be knocked out before the Mk III was rendered worthless, also it was thought that smaller engines were more efficient. As with the Mark II kinetic weapons were used. A marked return to the [[Viper Mark I|Mk I]] chassis (due to post-war cutbacks) allowed Mk IIIs to be produced rather cheaply. Unfortunately the final product was deemed a failure by many, as its engine system was cluttered with thrust transfer vents and it boasted a nightmarish computerized engine control system. The fighter wasn’t worth half the price of a Mk I on its best day.

===Overview ===
The Mk IV was a revolutionary step forward. Its was designed from the ground up to be a hybrid space/atmospheric versatility fighter. With nods to the Mk II it had three engines, two KEWs and one pilot. The biggest change was a force induction hood that surrounded the cockpit letting air straight into the engines this Viper was much more efficient in atmosphere burning only a quarter of the Tylium fuel needed to do the same run in a Mk II. Vents were added to the wings that could serve three purposes; more atmo pumped into systems, an extra lift duct or a aerospace booster brake. The last major addition was a bomblet bay located between and slightly below the lower engines.

===Overview===
The Mk V (scorpion) was up to that point the heaviest, most dangerous Viper to date. This was because the colonies were undergoing civil war and political upheaval. (Designed and first produced in Scorpia). The problem was that while more powerful and with heavier armor it was rather massive leading to maneuverability problems. It sported powerful engines and a third KEW plus had more hardpoints under the wings. Due to its mass its first battles were disasters in atmo Mk IVs could fly circles around the Mk V’s. Worse it literally “fell out of the sky” when not flown by an expert pilot in atmo. In space the turn radius was larger than those of early Raptors making them durable yet easy kills. Eventually Scorpia Arms increased the wing surfaces and added heavier reaction control thrusters making it a mean insurgent killing machine. However the upgrade cost and its reputation killed Viper Mk 5.1 in its tracks.

The '''Blackbird''' is a prototype Colonial stealth fighter craft constructed by Chief Petty Officer [[Galen Tyrol]] of the [[Battlestar Galactica]] - his deck crews, and other members of Galactica. This craft was meant to supplement the Viper, given the issues in maintaining the remaining craft aboard the battlestar. Chief Tyrol had originally intended just to build a standard Viper but ended up building a ship that was of more value to ''Galactica'' than another Viper.

==Construction==
The Blackbird is designed to use the [[Viper]] launch tubes, and therefore shares the same general shape. It is built more for speed than for maneuverability. The Blackbird is not equipped with any guns, but is equipped with a single missile hardpoint in &quot;[[Resurrection Ship, Part II]]&quot;.

It does not use metal for its exterior since this metal was reserved for Viper repairs. Instead, on [[Karl Agathon]]'s suggestion, the Blackbird uses a carbon composite material, which makes it largely invisible to DRADIS scanning.

The Blackbird is FTL-capable, but is not equipped with a Colonial transponder, either for stealth purposes or due to supply shortages.

==Avionics==
Along with the usual RCS mechanisms for directional control, the Blackbird is powered by four obsolete DDG-62 engines (designed by [[Peter Laird]], a civilian aeronautical engineer) that came from the flight deck of a Colonial fleet ship named [[Baah Pakal]]. One must speculate that since a typical Viper's engines are vulnerable to heat-seeking missiles (Miniseries), these must be as well. This would compromise its stealth features during powered flight. (This is less of a disadvantage in space than in atmospheric flight; a spacecraft's inertia is not disrupted by gravity, friction, and other factors an atmospheric-bound craft would be, and thus can fly straight almost indefinitely without firing its engines while in empty space.)

== Undoing Edits ==

Okay, I can see you've gone around undoing all of my edits. I was attempting to organise the articles since the categories weren't consistently named, and there was no clear distinction between TRS/Reimagining/TheNewSeries(TNS) and the old/classic/original series. Since there hadn't been any edits for a month, I figured it would be best to go ahead and try and sort this out, but clearly you disagree. So the best way to proceed would be to decide what would be best and then work together to ensure that's implemented fully and consistently.

The category structure I was mapping out is as follows:

*One root category for everything on the wiki. Whether it's [[:Category:Browse]] or [[:Category:Galactica Wiki]].
**In that root category are the main categories - one for each set of information ([[:Category:The New Series]] or [[:Category:Battlestar Galactica Re-Imagined]]). There were several
**Inside each of those, would be the main categories for that series - [[:Category:TNS Characters]], [[:Category:Colonial Fleet]], [[:Category:TNS Ships]], [[:Category:TNS Episodes]] etc
***I had a structure set out for the colonial fleet etc, since these had their names mixed up. The &quot;Colonial Fleet&quot; should refer to the whole military (before and after the attacks), separate to the civilian ships that form &quot;The Fleet&quot;.
****Within those categories would be sub-categories again for relevant things. So in characters would be cylons/humans/humanoidcylons/males/females etc. In Colonial Fleet would be ships/personnell/officers/pilots etc. In Episodes would perhaps be a subcategory for each season.

Note that I added TNS/TRS when there would be the same article in TOS. If there wouldn't be the same article, then there's no need for the TNS/TRS prefix. However, I also thought it would be good for this wiki to focus on one or the other - so [[:Category:Ships]] would refer to TNS/TRS rather than TOS or both; and any TOS articles/categories would be marked as TOS. That way, only one of them has to have a prefix, and it makes using the wiki a lot easier.

For the names, the reason I chose to (temporarily) use &quot;The New Series&quot; (TNS) rather than &quot;Re-imagining&quot; is because it's more obvious to new visitors, it's more obvious what it means, it's easy to remember (and guess), easier to type, and it's consistent accross every category and page name. Having a combination of &quot;Re-imagined&quot; and &quot;Re-imagining&quot; and &quot;Reimagined&quot; and &quot;Re-Imagined&quot; and &quot;TRS&quot; etc makes life very awkward.

If you disagree, could you suggest what you think the best layout would be? Before I edited, there were some duplicate categories and other problems, so even if you don't adopt my suggestion, there needs to be some sort of decision. We don't have to copy BattlestarWiki either. [[User:Gboyers|Gboyers]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Gboyers|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:42, June 4, 2010 (UTC)

:Don't worry, I'm not offended. I just hoped you weren't reverting them for no reason. Just to clarify my points:

*On the wikis I run (mostly [[:w:c:GTA|c:GTA]] and [[w:c:RedDead|c:RedDead]]), we use a Title Case naming system. So regardless of being proper nouns or not, everything is in title case (since they are the titles of pages), rather than sentence case (as they aren't sentences). I'm not saying you need to adopt that here, it's just my personal preference and since I was re-making the categories mostly from scratch, I decided to adopt it.

*With the wiki name, a long name such as 'Battlestar Galactica Wiki' makes life a little awkward, particularly in the [[Battlestar Galactica Wiki:Copyrights|project namespace]] where everything has a long title. With Battlestar wiki being a big competitor, it might be a good idea to have a different name, rather than being very similar to theirs, but again it depends what people will search for.

*[[:Category:Battlestar Galactica (Re-imagined Series) Season 1 episodes]] is a really long and unweildy name - I don't expect people to be able to type it accurately whilst looking (given all the punctuation and mixture of capitals), and definitely not from memory. If all TRS categories begin with &quot;Battlestar Galactica (Re-imagined Series)...&quot; then users have to type all that before being able to use the quick-hints. Could we shorten this to [[:Category:TRS Season 1]] or similar - do we need to suffix it with &quot;episodes&quot; when the category won't have much else in it? There could be sub-categories of it if required (ie for &quot;TRS Season 1 Characters&quot;) but I don't think these are necessary yet - keep things simple and concise and logical, then we can build from that pretty easily.

== William Adama ==

Well, we were all taken for a ride over on Caprica.  Little Willie Adama never grows up to become a starfleet officer.  I changed [[William Adama]] to reflect this.  I also added a couple of cross-Wikia references.  When I get around to &quot;Young Bill Adama&quot; over on my side of the house, I'll add a link to your operation.  I'm virtually a one-man show, so...

(If I do enough over here to justify the time, I'll build a sig.&lt;grin&gt;)

== Pages ripped off from battlestarwiki.org ==

Hi, You may know about the existence of battlestarwiki.org. Apparently the licensing used there is CC BY-NC-SA which is not the not compatible with the one used by Wikia. I have found that some of the pages here are a direct rip off, and a few other pages have large sections copied over. I request you, you being one of the Administrators, to remove or edit the content so that it stays acceptable as per Creative Commons. I have provided a list of pages which are in violation. Other pages also might be in violation.

=== These pages are a complete copy ===
* [[New Caprica]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/New_Caprica
* [[Pegasus]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Pegasus_(RDM)
* [[Viper_Mark_VII]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Viper_Mark_VII
* [[Viper_Mark_II]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Viper_Mark_II
* http://galactica.wikia.com/index.php?title=New_Caprica&amp;oldid=3941 from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/New_Caprica
* http://galactica.wikia.com/index.php?title=Pegasus&amp;oldid=4253 from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Pegasus_(RDM)
* [[Daybreak,_Part_I]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Daybreak,_Part_I
* http://galactica.wikia.com/index.php?title=Daybreak,_Part_I&amp;oldid=3605 from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Daybreak,_Part_I

=== These pages have large sections copied over ===
* http://galacticafanon.wikia.com/wiki/Humanoid_Cylon
* [[Humanoid Cylon]]
* [[Mythology]]
* [[Battle of New Caprica]]

=== These pages have been copied over from wikipedia ===

Now, Its perfectly alright to copy articles from wikipedia, as they use the same licensing. But that does not mean Attribution need not be given. I find no sort of attribution given to the authors on Wikipedia. This is a violation off CC BY-SA.

==Syfy Webring==
Hey Cavalier One,

It's Kate, we've talked on Harry Potter Wiki :) Since Wikia has awesome Syfy Wikis, we made a webring to affiliate them with each other. 

How would you feel about putting it on the mainpage? It looks like this: 

{{w:SyfyWikis}}

Let me know what you think!

http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/sixbitsnonethewiser/images/0/07/Kate_03.png&lt;staff/&gt;   &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Kate.moon|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:29, November 30, 2011 (UTC)

== Repeated occurrence of Copyright violations.  ==

====As per my previous post above. A new comer [[User:Wingman1]] just reverted all those articles which had copyright vilolations. So, what is the point of your deleting them in the first place. [[Special:Contributions/92.96.160.80|92.96.160.80]] 15:06, February 19, 2012 (UTC) Cavalier One, are you sure this guy is on the up and up? not telling you how to run your wiki, but on mine anon users making widespread changes usely means Vandalism attack. if help is need then you can find it here. http://community.wikia.com/wiki/index.php?search=Vandalism&amp;fulltext=0

let me know if i can be oh help in this matter.[[User:Wingman1|Wingman1]] 21:23, February 19, 2012 (UTC)</text>

&lt;references /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;

==Usage==
Use this template to create a reference list in an article.

If used with no parameters, it will simply produce a reference list in a small font.

===Multiple columns===
Using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{reflist|2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will create a two-column reference list, and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{reflist|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will create a three-column list.

Using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will allow the browser to automatically choose the number of columns based on the width of the web browser. Choose a column width that's appropriate for the average width of the references on the page.

This template is used to [[Wikipedia:WP:CITE|cite sources]] in Wikipedia. It is specifically for web sites which are not news sources. This template replaces deprecated [[Wikipedia:Template:Teb reference|template:web reference]]. It provides lower case parameters only.  

A general discussion of the use of templates for adding citation of open-source web content to Wikipedia articles is available at [[Wikipedia:Citation templates|citation templates]].

== Usage ==
;Common form for cases where little is known about authorship of the page (with current date)
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url= |title= |accessdate=&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTYEAR}}-{{CURRENTMONTH}}-{{CURRENTDAY2}}&lt;nowiki&gt; |format= |work= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

;Using last, first (with current date)
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url= |title= |accessdate=&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTYEAR}}-{{CURRENTMONTH}}-{{CURRENTDAY2}}&lt;nowiki&gt; |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

;Using author (with current date)
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url= |title= |accessdate=&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTYEAR}}-{{CURRENTMONTH}}-{{CURRENTDAY2}}&lt;nowiki&gt; |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

;Using non-linked retrieved date, last, first
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url= |title= |accessmonthday= |accessyear= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

;Using non-linked retrieved date, author
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url= |title= |accessmonthday= |accessyear= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

;All parameters, horizontal format (delete the ones you don't need)
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url= |title= |accessdate= |accessmonthday= |accessdaymonth = |accessyear= |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

| quote = 
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Required parameters ===
* '''url''': URL of online item.
* '''title''': Title of online item.
''For producing a [[Wikipedia:WP:CONTEXT#Dates|wikilinked date]] of retrieval:''
:* '''accessdate''': Full date when item was accessed, in [[Wikipedia:ISO 8601|ISO 8601]] YYYY-MM-DD format, for example &quot;accessdate = {{CURRENTYEAR}}-{{CURRENTMONTH}}-{{CURRENTDAY2}}&quot;. ''Must not be wikilinked''
''For producing a non-wikilinked date of retrieval:''
:* '''accessmonthday''' and '''accessyear''': Month and day when item was accessed, for example &quot;accessmonthday = May 10&quot;, &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; year when item was accessed, for example &quot;accessyear = 2005&quot;. Produces: ''Retrieved on May 10, 2006.''
:* '''accessdaymonth''' and '''accessyear''': Month and day when item was accessed, for example &quot;accessmonthday = 10 May&quot;, &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; year when item was accessed, for example &quot;accessyear = 2005&quot;. Produces: ''Retrieved on 10 May 2006.''

=== Optional parameters ===
* '''author''': Author
** '''last''' works with '''first''' to produce &lt;code&gt;last, first&lt;/code&gt;
** '''authorlink''' works either with '''author''' or with '''last''' &amp; '''first''' to link to the appropriate wikipedia article. Does not work with URLs.
** '''coauthors''': allows additional authors
* '''date''': Full date of publication, preferably in [[Wikipedia:ISO 8601|ISO 8601]] YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. ''2006-02-17''. May be wikilinked.
** OR:  '''year''': Year of publication, and '''month''': Name of the month of publication. If you also have the day, use ''date'' instead. Must not be wikilinked.
* '''format''': Format, e.g. PDF.  HTML implied if not specified.
* '''work''': If this item is part of a larger work, name of that work.
* '''publisher''': Publisher, if any.
* '''pages''': ''pp. 5–7'': first page and optional last page. This is for listing the pages relevant to the citation, not the total number of pages in the book.  This is especially useful for [[PDF]] format, where the page can be linked to with the &lt;code&gt;#page=''number''&lt;/code&gt; anchor tagged on the end of the URL: 
*: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;pages = [http://www.example.org/file.pdf#page=123 p. 123]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* '''language''': language of publication (don't specify &quot;English&quot; as this is the default).
* '''archiveurl''': URL of the archive location of the item (requires '''archivedate''')
* '''archivedate''': Date when the item was archived (requires '''archiveurl'''), in [[Wikipedia:ISO 8601|ISO 8601]] YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. ''2006-02-17''. Must not be wikilinked; it will be linked automatically.
* '''quote''': Relevant quote from online item.

This template is used to [[WP:CITE|cite sources]] in Wikipedia. It is specifically for books. This template replaces the deprecated {{tl|book reference}}. When citing an article in a compilation or anthology, {{tl|cite journal}} or {{tl|cite encyclopedia}} work better. __NOTOC__

==Usage==

All field names '''must''' be in [[lowercase]].

Copy a blank version to use. Remember to use the &quot;|&quot; (pipe) character between each field. Please delete any unused fields to avoid clutter in the edit window.

No templates or magic words are necessary when using an [[ISBN]], [[OCLC]] number, or [[Digital object identifier|DOI]] as an identifier.  Instead of using the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; field in these instances, simply use the appropriate field.  For instance, type &lt;code&gt;isbn=&lt;/code&gt; followed by the number instead of &lt;code&gt;id=ISBN&lt;/code&gt;.  Templates are available for other identification number types to be used in the ID field ({{tl|ISSN}}, {{tl|LCCN}}, {{tl|LCC}}, etc.) if these aren't available.  See also the complete [[#Description of fields|description of fields]].

† This is the preferred field with its alternates listed below. 

&amp;Dagger; If {{para|chapterurl}} is provided then {{para|chapter}} can not have wikilinks.

==Fields==
===Wikilinks===
Except where specifically prohibited in the field descriptions below, most fields can be wikilinked (e.g. &lt;code&gt;title = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[book article|book title]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), but should generally only be linked to an existing Wikipedia article. Wikilinked fields must escape the characters &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&gt;[]{}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; rather than including them directly.

===Description of fields===
====Syntax (for the technical-minded)====
Nested fields rely on their parent fields:
*''parent''
*OR: ''parent2'' &amp;mdash; may be used instead  of ''parent''
**''child'' &amp;mdash; may be used with ''parent'' (and is ignored if ''parent'' is not used)
**OR: ''child2'' &amp;mdash; may be used instead of ''child'' (and is ignored if ''parent2'' is not used)

====Description====
*'''last''': Surname of author. Don't wikilink (use ''authorlink'' instead).
**'''first''': First name(s) of author, including title(s) (e.g. ''Firstname Middlename'' or ''Firstname M.'' or ''Dr. Firstname M., Snr.''). Don't wikilink (use ''authorlink'' instead).
***The 'last' and 'first' fields are not ideally suited to authors whose surname is usually written first (e.g. as in Chinese).  Use the same format as the source uses to handle these cases.
**{{AuthorMask doc}} See [[#Examples|Examples]] for typical usage.
**'''authorlink''': Title of Wikipedia article about author (not the author's personal website). Article should already exist. Must not be wikilinked itself. Do not use this on its own, but along with ''author'' or ''first'' and ''last''.
**'''coauthors''': Full name of additional author or authors, separated by &quot;, &quot; (e.g. ''Joe Bloggs, John F. Kennedy, H. R. Dent'').
***Whether the surname of the co-authors goes first or last is dependent on the citation style (see the [[#Citation_styles|citation style]] section below) preferred.
*OR: '''author''': Full name of author, preferably surname first. (deprecated) Don't wikilink (use ''authorlink'' instead).
*OR: for multiple authors, use the fields '''first1''', '''last1''', ...,&lt;b&gt;first''n'', last''n''&lt;/b&gt; to 'correctly' record all the information about the book (the first nine authors are printed, then ''et al.'' is appended if even more authors were specified). Don't wikilink as there are corresponding '''authorlink1''', ..., '''authorlink9''' fields as well. This usage is preferred to the use of '''coauthors'''.
*'''editor''': Name of editor/editors. Do not Wikilink any values in the editor field but use ''editor-link'' instead. The template automatically adds &quot;ed.&quot; after the editor's name unless the ''chapter'' parameter is used in which case the template adds &quot;in&quot; before the editor's name which appears after the chapter and before the title. This implies that the author is responsible only for part of the book (including the cited chapter) and the editor responsible for the whole book. If, however, the author(s) and editor(s) are responsible for the whole book, then the ''editor'' field or its alternates described below should not be used if the ''chapter'' field is being used. Instead, the editor(s) should be included in an ''author'' field with possibly &quot;(ed.)&quot; after the surname(s). Alternatively, the ''editor'' field may be used if the chapter detail is included in the ''title'' field instead of using the ''chapter'' field.
*OR: alternatively '''editor-first''' and '''editor-last''' can be used in the same way as ''first'' and ''last''.
*OR: for multiple editors up to four in number, use the fields '''editor1-first''', '''editor1-last''', ...,&lt;b&gt;editor''n''-first, editor''n''-last&lt;/b&gt; to 'correctly' record all the information about the book in the same way as ''first''n and ''last''n.
**'''editor-link''' or '''editor1-link'''...&lt;b&gt;editor''n''-link&lt;/b&gt; is used in the same way as ''authorlink'' or ''authorlink''n.
*'''others''': To record other contributors to the work, such as &quot;illustrated by Smith&quot; or &quot;trans. Smith&quot;. 
*'''title''': Title of book. This is the only required parameter. Can be wikilinked but only to an existing Wikipedia article. Do not use italics.
**'''trans_title''': If the book cited is in a foreign language, an English translation of the title can be given here. The template will display this in square brackets after the ''title'' field and it will point to the ''url'' link, if used. Use of ''language'' parameter is recommended if this parameter is used.
*'''url''': URL of an online location where text of the book can be found. Cannot be used if you wikilinked ''title''. If applicable, should point to the specific page(s) referenced.  Do not use this field to link to any commercial booksellers (such as Amazon.com).  The [[Wikipedia:ISBN|ISBN link]] is a much better alternative which allows readers access to the books in their own countries or through their own choice of source, including Amazon, Google Books, thousands of libraries, and more.
**'''format''': Format, e.g. PDF. HTML implied if not specified.
**'''accessdate''': Full date when url was accessed. Should be used when ''url'' field is used. Should be in the same format as other dates in citations in the same article. Must not be wikilinked.
*'''type''': If the publication is a thesis or dissertation, the type can be specified here. For example, &lt;code&gt;type=PhD thesis&lt;/code&gt; produces &quot;(PhD thesis)&quot; immediately after the title.
*'''edition''': When the book has more than one edition. ''e.g.:'' &quot;2nd.&quot;, &quot;Revised&quot; etc.. Note that the template automatically displays &quot; ed.&quot; after this field, so &lt;code&gt;edition=2nd&lt;/code&gt; produces &quot;2nd ed.&quot;.
*'''series''': When the book is part of a series of publications
*'''volume''': For one book published in several volumes. However, this template displays the text in this field in bold type after the ''title'' and ''series'' parameters. An alternative is to include the volume information in the ''title'' field after the main title (see example below). (NB: there is a separate {{tl|Cite encyclopedia}} template).
*'''date''': Full date of publication edition being referenced, in the same format as other dates in citations in the same article. Must not be wikilinked.
*OR:  '''year''': Year of publication edition being referenced
**'''month''': Name of the month of publication. If you also have the day, use ''date'' instead. Must not be wikilinked.
**'''origyear''': Original publication year, for display alongside the date or year.  For clarity, please supply specifics, for instance &lt;code&gt;origyear=First published 1859&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;origyear=Composed 1904&lt;/code&gt;. This parameter only displays if a there is a value for ''year'' or ''date''.
*'''publisher''': Publisher should not include corporate designation such as &quot;Ltd&quot; or &quot;Inc&quot;.
**'''location''': Geographical place of publication.
*'''language''': The language the book is written in, if it is not English. The template automatically puts parentheses around the text and adds &quot;in&quot; before the language name. 
*'''isbn''': [[International Standard Book Number]] such as ''1-111-22222-9''.  Note that {{para|isbn}}, like all field names, must be in lowercase. The field must not be wikilinked as the template automatically creates a link. The template is insensitive to formatting so an ISBN number without dashes (&quot;-&quot;) may be used (e.g. {{para|isbn|1111222229}}). Please use the 13-digit ISBN where possible; this can normally be found beneath the barcode as a number beginning 978 or 979. For books with the older SBN system (9 digits), use this field but prefix the number with a zero; thus ''SBN 902888 45 5'' should be entered as {{para|isbn|0 902888 45 5}}.  More information about this feature and its advantages is available at [[Wikipedia:ISBN]].
*'''oclc''': [[Online Computer Library Center]] ID number, such as ''3185581''. The field must not be wikilinked as the template automatically creates a link.
*'''doi''': A [[digital object identifier]] such as ''&lt;nowiki&gt;10.1016/j.coi.2004.08.001&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. The field must not be wikilinked as the template automatically creates a link.
*'''bibcode''': A nineteen character [[Bibcode]] identifier. The field must not be wikilinked as the template automatically creates a link.
*'''id''': A [[unique identifier]], used if none of the above are applicable.  In this case, you need to specify the kind of identifier you are using, preferably with a template like {{tl|ASIN}} or {{tl|ISSN}}.  (Use one of the more specialized parameters if possible; they are linked automatically.  In other words, don't use {{para|id|ISBN 1-111-22222-9}} anymore; use {{para|isbn|1-111-22222-9}}. If the book has a SBN but not an ISBN, see {{para|isbn}}.)
*'''pages''' or '''page''': These parameters are for listing the pages relevant to the citation, ''not'' the total number of pages in the book. &quot;&lt;code&gt;|pages= 5–7&lt;/code&gt;&quot; produces &quot;pp. 5–7&quot;, while &quot;&lt;code&gt;|page= 5&lt;/code&gt;&quot; produces &quot;p. 5&quot;. The &quot;pp.&quot; notation indicating multiple pages, and &quot;p.&quot; notation indicating a single page, ''are placed automatically'' when you choose between the plural (''pages'') or singular (''page'') form of the parameter. 
**'''nopp''': using &quot;page&quot; or &quot;pages&quot;, automatically places the p. or pp. notations. If this is inappropriate—for instance, if &lt;code&gt;page=Front cover&lt;/code&gt;, placing any value after &lt;code&gt;nopp&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;nopp=y&lt;/code&gt; will hide the p. or pp. notation.
*'''chapter''' (= '''contribution'''): The chapter of the book, written in full. Punctuation other than quotes should be included in the value passed to the parameter, e.g. {{para|chapter|Chapter 12: Meet Dick and Jane.}} produces &quot;Chapter 12: Meet Dick and Jane.&quot; ahead of ''title''.
**'''trans_chapter''': Acts in the same way as ''trans_title''. The field will be displayed in square brackets within the quotation marks which embrace the ''chapter'' field. Use of ''language'' parameter is recommended if this parameter is used.   
**'''chapterurl''': URL of an individual chapter of online book. Should be at the same site as ''url'', if any.
*'''quote''': Relevant quote from the book.
*'''ref''': ID for anchor. By default, no anchor is generated. The ordinary nonempty value {{para|ref|&lt;var&gt;ID&lt;/var&gt;}} generates an anchor with the given &lt;code&gt;&lt;var&gt;ID&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;; such a linkable reference can be made the target of [[Wikipedia:Citing sources/Further considerations #Wikilinks to full references|wikilinks to full references]], especially useful in short citations like [[Wikipedia:Citing sources #Shortened footnotes|shortened notes]] and [[Wikipedia:Parenthetical referencing|parenthetical referencing]]. The special value {{para|ref|harv}} generates an anchor suitable for the {{tl|harv}} template; see ''[[Template:Citation/doc #Anchors for Harvard referencing templates|anchors for Harvard referencing templates]]''. See &quot;Wikilinks to full references&quot; in [[#Examples|Examples]] below for using the ''ref'' field in citation templates in conjunction with short &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; citations.
*'''laysummary''': Link to a non-technical summary (or review) of the book
**'''laydate''': Date of summary
*'''separator''': The separator to use in lists of authors, editors, ''etc''.  Defaults to &quot;.&quot;, but &quot;,&quot; may be useful also.
*'''postscript''': The closing punctuation for the citation.  Defaults to &quot;.&quot;, but &quot;&quot; may be useful also.
*'''lastauthoramp''': The separator to use between the last two names in lists of authors.  Defaults to &quot;&quot;, but &quot;&amp;amp;&quot; may be useful as well.

:As mentioned, the bibliographical data of the cited source can be “tagged” by an identifier: this enables the system to “find” the target of the wikilinks. This “tagging” with an identifier can be done by enclosing between &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;cite id=…&gt;…&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, but this tool can be superfluous if the bibliographical data are provided with a citation template: the &lt;tt&gt;ref&lt;/tt&gt; field of the chosen citation template must be set to the same name.

:Attention must be paid: not all other citation templates support this. In such cases, the service can be achieved also by enclosing the concerned bibliographical item inside &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;cite id=…&gt;…&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags: also this way, it can feature as a target of [[Wikipedia:Citing sources/Further considerations#Wikilinks to full_references|Wikilinks to full references]]. The &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; attribute of the tag must be set to the same name what we would give to the (lacking) &lt;tt&gt;ref&lt;/tt&gt; field of the citation template.

==Testing==
See [[Template:cite book/regression tests]].

==Note==
Note the extra full-stop when the last author ends with an initial, and there is no date:
*{{cite book | last = Invisible | first = M. | title = Mysterious book }}
We don't know of a practical solution to this &amp;mdash; unless there is a way to test the characters of a field?

==Citation styles==
Established citation styles for coauthors:

*[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/cws/wworkshop/writer_resources/citation_styles/mla/mla.htm MLA style]{{dl}}: Last, First and First Last. &quot;If there are more than three authors, you may list only the first author followed by the phrase ''et al''.&quot;
*[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/cws/wworkshop/writer_resources/citation_styles/apa/apa.htm APA style]{{dl}}: Last, F. &amp; Last, F.
*[http://www.liunet.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workshop/citchi.htm Chicago Manual of Style]: Last, First, and First Last.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1918">{{Documentation subpage}}
&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. --&gt;

This is the {{tl|pp-template}} protection notice.

It is used on protected templates and on protected file (image) pages.

This template does not show on pages that are not protected, instead it reports an error. Please note that only [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]] can protect pages, this template only informs about the protection status of the page.

This template should usually not be manually placed on template pages, since it is automatically loaded by the {{tl|Documentation}} template of protected template pages. Protected templates (both semi and full) should preferably have a documentation subpage (/doc) so that any editor can update the documentation, categories and interwiki links of the template. See [[Wikipedia:Template documentation]] for more on that.

This template automatically detects the edit protection level (semi or full) of a page, and if it is on a template or file page, and modifies its appearance and how it categorizes the page.

* Use {{tlc|pp-template}} for the normal appearance (a small icon at the top).
* Use {{tlc|pp-template|small&amp;#61;no}} for the large message box. On file pages we recommend using the large box. (It is usually a good idea to also add the {{tl|nocommons}} box on protected image pages, to remind people that protected images should not be deleted even if there is a backup copy on Commons.)

When {{tl|pp-template}} is added to a protected template, it should be placed inside {{tag|noinclude}} tags (otherwise, every page which uses the template will load the protection notice, which will result in an error message). On file (image) pages the &amp;lt;noinclude&gt;&amp;lt;/noincluce&gt; tags are not necessary.

{{Quote|Admiral Nagala's dead. The Battlestar ''Atlantia''{{'s}} been destroyed. So's the ''Triton'', the ''Solaria'', the ''Columbia''&amp;hellip;the list goes on.|Commander William Adama during the Fall of the Twelve Colonies|Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)}}

The '''''Triton''''' was a [[Battlestar]] in service to the [[Colonial Fleet]] following the [[Cylon War]]. When the [[Cylon]]s [[Fall of the Twelve Colonies|attacked]] the [[Twelve Colonies]] forty years after the end of the Cylon War, the ''Triton'' engaged enemy forces after the first wave of the offensive resulted in the destruction of [[Picon Fleet Headquarters]] and the destruction of a quarter of the Fleet. The ''Triton'' was subsequently destroyed by Cylon forces.

During its time in the Fleet, it was commanded at some point by [[Commander]] [[James Jonasson]], and former crew members included [[Lieutenant]] [[Alex Quartararo|Alex &quot;Crashdown&quot; Quartararo]], and [[Junior Lieutenant]] [[Kara Thrace|Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace]].

==Description==
The ''Triton'' was a [[Battlestar]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ep33&quot; /&gt; one of around one hundred and twenty that served in the [[Colonial Fleet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Miniseries&quot; /&gt; and was suited for both offensive and defensive actions. The vessel carried an assortment of [[Viper]] fighter craft and [[Raptor]] support vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;BSGRPG&quot; /&gt;

==History==
The ''Triton'' served in the Colonial Fleet following the [[Cylon War]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Miniseries&quot;&gt;[[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|''Battlestar Galactica'']]&lt;/ref&gt; and was assigned to [[Battlestar Group]] [[Battlestar Group 39|39]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ep33&quot; /&gt; which was part of the [[Aerilon Combat 5th Division]]. At some point, [[Commander]] [[James Jonasson]] was the commanding officer of the ''Triton''. During his tenure as commanding officer, [[Junior Lieutenant]] [[Kara Thrace]] served aboard the vessel as a Viper [[pilot]]. Jonasson filed disciplinary charges against her.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAR&quot; /&gt;

The ''Triton'' was still in service during the events surrounding the [[Fall of the Twelve Colonies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miniseries&quot; /&gt; [[Lieutenant]] [[Alex Quartararo]], an [[Electronic Countermeasures Officer]] and qualified [[Raptor]] pilot, was part of the crew at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ep33&quot; /&gt; After the destruction of [[Picon Fleet Headquarters]] in the first wave of the [[Cylon]] offensive, [[Admiral]] [[Nagala]] took personal command of the Fleet aboard the Battlestar ''[[Atlantia]]''. During the subsequent engagement, the ''Triton'', along with the ''Atlantia'', ''[[Columbia]]'' and ''[[Solaria]]'', were destroyed by Cylon forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miniseries&quot; /&gt; Quartararo survived the destruction of the Battlestar, and later joined up with the [[civilian fleet]] guarded by the Battlestar ''[[Galactica]]'' as it fled the destruction of the [[Twelve Colonies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ep33&quot; /&gt;

==Behind the scenes==
The ''Triton'' was first mentioned in the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|television miniseries]] that aired in [[2003]] when Commander [[William Adama]] lists the names of several Battlestars that had been destroyed in the Cylon offensive. The ''Triton'' was later mentioned in the first episode of the [[Battlestar Galactica (Re-Imagined Series) Season 1|first season]], entitled ''[[33]]'' when Lieutenant [[Sharon Valerii]] notes that Alex Quartararo, her new Electronic Countermeasures Officer, was a &quot;refugee from Triton&quot;. Quartararo's flight suit also included a patch for the Battlestar Triton on its upper left arm. The ''Triton'' was later referenced in the episode ''[[The Son Also Rises]]''; while viewing Kara Thrace's personnel file, a record of a disciplinary hearing noted that she was serving on the ''Triton'' at the time of the incident.

The ''Triton'' references the Battlestar ''[[Triton (Original Series)|Triton]]'', one of the ships named in the [[Saga of a Star World|pilot]] of the [[Battlestar Galactica (Original Series)|original series]] that was destroyed during the [[Battle of Cimtar]].

When the [[Cylon]]s launched their surprise [[Fall of the Twelve Colonies|attack]] against the [[Twelve Colonies]], the ''Atlantia'' survived the initial assault. With the destruction of [[Picon Fleet Headquarters]], [[Admiral]] [[Nagala]] took personal command of the Fleet, basing himself on the ''Atlantia''. During a subsequent engagement, the ''Atlantia'' was destroyed by Cylon forces.'''''''

Atlantia

In the events of the miniseries, after the destruction of Colonial Fleet Headquarters on Picon in the first wave of the Cylon attack, Admiral Nagala takes command of the fleet from the Atlantia. Atlantia is one of the first Battlestars to engage the Cylons after the attack. The Atlantia is newer and more advanced than the Galactica, and has an integrated computer network running Doctor Gaius Baltar's Command Navigation Program, which allows the Cylons to infiltrate the system and cripple the vessel. As a result, Atlantia is easily destroyed by the Cylons over the planet Virgon.

Episodes of the re-imagined series establish that William Adama served on the Battlestar Atlantia as a Major, where he had an ongoing feud with that ship's landing signal officer that inspired a celebration of his thousandth landing. Chief Galen Tyrol says he also served on board the Atlantia prior to his assignment to the Galactica.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="908">{Columbia

There seem to have been at least two ships named Battlestar Columbia mentioned in the re-imagined series.

The first Columbia mentioned is in the Mini-series as one of the Battlestars lost along with the Battlestars Triton and Solaria during the Cylon sneak attack on the colonies.

During the regular series, it is mentioned that William Adama served on the Columbia as executive officer after his reinstatement in the Colonial Fleet and prior to his taking command of the Battlestar Valkyrie.

The second Columbia is apparently the ship's predecessor, appearing in the Battlestar Galactica: Razor movie. This Columbia appeared of a similar design to Galactica and is destroyed in a battle with Cylon Basestars during Operation Raptor Talon over a planet where the Cylons are found experimenting on human subjects'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1147">A '''Battlestar''' was the main military [[starship]] deployed by the [[Colonial Fleet]] of the [[Twelve Colonies]]. It operated around one hundred and twenty Battlestars of various classes, divided into [[Battlestar Group]]s. A battleship and carrier hybrid, the Battlestar was a ship to be reckoned with. Vipers, the fighters that a Battlestar carries, are small, one-man ships that generally have 2 to 3 small guns on them, plus missile hardpoints. These ship are fast, and they can be used to defend the mother ship or carry out offensive strike missions to enemy forces. The other armenent a Battlestar has is in the form of railguns; heavy cannons capable of firing incindiary shells or explosive shells. Both are used against enemy capital ships. Other weapons a Battlestar carries include point-defense weapons, and nuclear missiles.

: Admiral Helena Cain.&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Galactica.JPG|thumb|300px|BS 75 Galactica]]


The '''Battlestar Galactica (BS 75)''' was o[[File:300px_Logo_B_GALACTICA_BSG75_T.png|thumb|275px]]ne of the [[Galactica Type Battlestar|first Battlestar]] vessels to be constructed in the defence of the Twelve Colonies. The last ship of its class to still be in service of the Colonial Military Fleet, a few regarded Galactica as a ‘classic’, though many saw the her as a relic. With no Integrated Defence Software and no computer network, she was scheduled for decommission. With the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies, Galactica become the sole protector of the civilian fleet in the search for earth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==Timeline==
*During the [[First Cylon War]] (which takes place before the events of the new series), Galactica was built to represent the [[Caprica]] colony. She was built without networked computers to avoid being hacked by the [[Cylons]]
*During the 10th year of the Cylon war, rookie (fresh meat) [[William Adama]] comes aboard the ''Galactica''. After Lt. Adama's first mission and rescue the ''Galactica'' and the [[Ghost Fleet]] launched a new offensive.
*During the First Cylon War, Galactica along with the Columbia and one other unnamed Battlestar took part in [[Operation Raptor Talon]]; where the Columbia is destroyed with all hands.
*Many years after the war, Galactica was one of the oldest ships in the fleet, and was scheduled to be decommissioned and turned into a museum. Various conversions were taking place and most of her onboard squadrons were removed.
*During the decommissioning ceremony, the cylon attacks on the colonies began. After a battle, including many direct strikes, Galactica successfully jumped away to the [[Ragnar Anchorage]] depot.
*Galactica then leads and defends a small fleet of civilian ships on the search for resources and a new place to settle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4164">The Reimagined Series (2003)

During the First Cylon War, the mechanical Cylons and Humans fought to a draw. An armistice was signed and the two sides drew a border between Colonial (Human) space and Cylon space. The Cylons withdrew into their own territory to form their own society, and generally avoided any contact with Humans for the next four decades. At the edge of Human space, an Armistice Station was built to allow Humans and Cylons to meet for diplomatic relations. Each year the Humans sent an officer; the Cylons sent no one—until 40 years after the war ended, when the Cylons suddenly reappeared at Armistice Station with no warning. But now they no longer resembled machines; instead they looked exactly like ordinary Humans. The Cylons destroyed the [[Armistice Station]], thus beginning their final assault on the [[Twelve Colonies]] and Humanity.

After destroying the Armistice Station, the Cylons launched a sneak attack against the entire Colonial fleet. Taking advantage of their immense knowledge of advanced technology, the Cylons exploited a backdoor in the Colonial military's software written into Dr. Gaius Baltar's programs by [[Number Six]], a Cylon working undercover who had become Baltar's lover, and who deliberately used him to find weaknesses in the Colonial defense systems he had designed.

Using the knowledge they had gained from the unwitting Baltar, the Cylons were able to override the sophisticated computer systems on each battlestar and viper fighter in the fleet and shut them down, thus rendering the ships defenseless. Within a few hours virtually the entire Colonial fleet had been destroyed. Despite President Adar's &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; of the Twelve Colonies, the Cylons did not respond, and detonated nuclear bombs on each of the planets. Casualties were extreme, and within a few hours, over 50 billion humans were dead. Within 24 hours after their initial attack, only the battlestars [[Galactica]] and [[Pegasus]] had survived, although they would not learn of each other's existence for some time. The Cylons, sometime after, occupied the Twelve Colonies. The nuclear attack did irreversible damage to the planets themselves: the nukes spread out so much radiation and did so much damage that the planets were going to go into nuclear winter according to Gaius Baltar. Caprica was shown to be clearly changing just days after the attack, and any survivors needed a supply of anti-radiation medication. The once blue-green world's sky turned noticeably orange, with the trees and vegetation slowly dying from radiation. Even though the Cylons ultimately abandoned the Colonies, the humans couldn't return to their homeworlds, as they were now devastated nuclear wastelands and were now uninhabitable for a very long time (as of the present day, some 150,000 years and counting).

[[The Plan]] shows exactly what happened: after preparing a massive fleet at The Colony (Cylon base that was basically the Cylon home world and site of the final battle between Galactica and the Cylons), the Cylons jumped their fleet into the orbits of the Twelve Colonies. Three battlestars in orbit of Caprica detected them, but one of the Hybrids hacked into the [[Defense Mainframe]] using the [[CNP]] backdoor and shut it down so the people on the ground couldn't detect them and defend against them. [[Raiders]] used the CNP weakness to disable the battlestars in orbit and their fighters and then launched massive pods containing multiple (at least a dozen) nuclear missiles each at each of the Colonies. Once the pods reached a certain height, they broke open and the nuclear missiles spread out and struck their various targets, nuking the Colonies. The Cavils hoped that the [[Final Five]] would have learned their lesson about humanity, be killed in the nuclear destruction and download into new bodies on board a Resurrection Ship, but each survived the attack with [[Cavil]] even helping Ellen out as he felt she hadn't learned her lesson and needed to live among humans for longer to learn it.

==Show Notes==
*Originally aired in two parts. Released as its own DVD and as part of the Season 1 DVD set.
*In the opening scene the man in the station looks at the plans for a ''[[Cylon Centurion Model 0005]]''. The model is from the original series.
*In the picture of his wife and child, the child is [[Boxey]]. In commentaries [[Ronald D Moore|Ronald Moore]] has said he tried to have most of the original characters in the show including [[Boxey]] although he had to fight with the Network to keep the character. Ironically Boxey does not last past the [[Bastille Day|third episode]] of the first season.
*''[[Galactica]]'' is noted as the ''the last of her kind still in service'' and ''constructed over 50 years ago in the early days of the Cylon conflict.'' We know the war ended over 40 years prior to this point so the war may have lasted around 10 years.
*Originally there were 12 [[Battlestar]]s, one for each of the twelve colonies with ''Galactica'' representing [[Caprica]]. It was first commanded by Commander Nash.
*The dialogue when [[Kara Thrace]] jogs past [[Commander]] [[William Adama]] is meant to be part of military [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jody_call jody call] or cadence call:
**Adama: ''What do you hear?&quot;''
**Starbuck: ''Nothin' but the rain.''
**Adama: ''Grab your gun and bring in the cat.''
**Starbuck: ''Boom, Boom, Boom.''
*The [[Mark II Viper]] has been out of service for at least 20 years.
* [[Commander]] [[William Adama]]'s call sign was ''Husker'' and the serial number on his Viper was ''N2742C''. In an apparent nod to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet NATO Phonetic Alphabet] ''N'' is ''Nebula'' and ''C'' is ''Constellation''. [[Galen Tyrol]] says they found her ''rusting out in a salvage yard in [[Sagitarian]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28334">'''Sharon Valerii''', callsign '''Boomer''', was a [[Humanoid Cylon|humanoid Cylon]] sleeper agent posing as a [[Colonial Fleet]] officer assigned to the [[Galactica]].



==Life on Caprica and Galactica==

Lieutenant Junior Grade Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii is a Cylon sleeper agent programmed to believe she is human. For example, she has been implanted with false memories of being raised on Troy by her parents Katherine and Abraham Valerii, who supposedly died in an accident killing all the members on the mining colony. Whether or not Katherine and Abraham actually existed is unknown. In the time before the mini-series, Boomer and Galen Tyrol are romantically involved, although their relationship is against military protocol (she is an officer, he's enlisted). Due to her programming, she performs a number of sabotage actions (including bombing the Galactica's water tanks) but has no conscious memory of these actions. Tyrol trusts her and hides evidence implicating her in the water bombing but later suspicious events cause him to break off his relationship with her. In time, she begins to suspect something may be wrong with her. She asks Gaius Baltar to administer a blood test to determine whether she is a Cylon. Although his test demonstrates she is in fact a Cylon, he decides to not inform anyone out of fear she will kill him. She is relieved for a while but gradually her suspicions return and she attempts suicide. Her programming, however, prevents her from killing herself.

In the episode &quot;Kobol's Last Gleaming&quot;, Commander Adama sends Boomer on a mission to destroy the basestar orbiting Kobol. On the basestar, she encounters numerous other Number Eight copies identical to herself but she refuses to accept she is a Cylon and personally sets the bomb. After returning to Galactica, her hidden programming takes over and she shoots Commander Adama twice in the chest, putting him in a coma. She is put in the brig and violently interrogated by Colonel Tigh, who has taken command of Galactica during Adama's incapacity. Tyrol is also suspected of being a Cylon because of his relationship with her, and is thrown in her cell. He tells her not to speak to him or even touch him; he insists she is a machine and nothing like him.&lt;br /&gt;

===&lt;br /&gt;Death and Resurrection===

Gaius Baltar forces Boomer to tell him how many other Cylons are still hidden in the fleet by injecting Tyrol with a substance that stops his heart and refusing to administer the antidote. Sharon finally tells Gaius there are eight Cylons in the fleet. She is shot and killed by Cally, who blames her for Tyrol's imprisonment; Cally herself is in love with Tyrol as is made clear in later episodes. Sharon dies in Tyrol's arms, telling him she loves him.[1]

In the episode &quot;Downloaded&quot;, it is revealed Boomer's consciousness has been downloaded into a new body. She tries to live on Caprica like in her old life as a human. She resists being identified with the Cylon cause, although they view her and Caprica Six as heroes. Over time, she begins to open up to Caprica Six, who like her has been transformed by their love for a human. They decide to try to persuade the Cylons some of their actions against mankind are wrong. Number Three threatens to have them &quot;boxed&quot;, that is, placing their consciousness into &quot;cold storage&quot;. Boomer is among the Cylons occupying New Caprica. She has accepted herself as a Cylon and is fully integrated back into their society. She functions as a member of the Cylon governing council that controls the puppet human government under President Gaius Baltar. Her desire remains to show humans and Cylons can co-exist, however, relations between the two groups turn increasingly hostile. Boomer visits Cally who has been imprisoned to tell her she is doing everything that she can to free her, and attempts to make peace. She indicates she has accepted Tyrol moving on and starting a family with Cally. However, Cally remains distrustful and angrily rebuffs her.&lt;br /&gt;

===Relation to Hera Agathon and 2nd Death===

In the episode &quot;The Eye of Jupiter&quot;, Boomer is seen attempting to care for Athena's hybrid child Hera, who is mysteriously ill. She is frustrated by the child's deteriorating health and their inability to bond. She later joins D'Anna and Cavil when they go to meet Adama and Roslin on Galactica. Athena identifies Boomer as the Cylon who shot Adama, and Tigh informs her that her visiting privileges have been revoked. Boomer tells Athena that Hera is still alive and living among the Cylons, but has fallen ill.

Athena arrives on the Cylon Base Ship and is reunited with Hera who immediately stops crying. Caprica Six is amazed how Hera responds to being back with her &quot;real mother&quot;, however Boomer is upset. Athena determines Hera would best be treated by a human doctor. Boomer accuses her of having planned to take Hera back to Galactica from the start. Boomer says the failure of New Caprica has taught her humans and Cylons cannot co-exist and should go their separate ways. Throughout this meeting, Boomer becomes increasingly distressed and emotionally unstable. She suggests Cavil may be right that the Cylons are not supposed to have children, and ultimately threatens to snap Hera's neck, but her own neck is snapped by Caprica Six for endangering the future of the Cylon race.&lt;br /&gt;

===&lt;br /&gt;2nd Resurrection and Relation with John Cavil===

Shortly thereafter, Boomer again resurrects. She has begun to develop a relationship with John Cavil, a Cylon who embraces his machine nature and sees human traits as a weakness. Cavil insists the Raiders should undergo a procedure to remove or at least reduce their sentience, and he enlists Boomer's aid when the Cylons become deadlocked over the matter. While her fellow Eights vote as a group against the procedure, Boomer decides to vote yes in order to make the Raiders effective fighters once again. In so doing, she becomes the first Cylon to ever vote against her own model (meaning that in a six-vote bloc, she casts an unheard-of seventh vote).

After Cavil is gunned down by Natalie's forces, he resurrects and begins to plot the permanent death of the opposing Cylons, including Boomer's fellow Eights, by killing them out of range of a Resurrection ship. Boomer has doubts about killing her &quot;own sisters&quot;, and when Cavil reassures her the souls of the others will be looked after by God, she asks, &quot;what about our souls?&quot; Cavil assures her, &quot;We're machines, machines don't have souls.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

===&lt;br /&gt;Relation to Ellen Tigh and Return to Galactica===

Boomer is the only other Cylon who Cavil has told that he is keeping their creator, Ellen Tigh, prisoner. He teaches Boomer to let go of her human traits to become a better machine. Cavil describes Boomer as &quot;self-destructive, hyper-emotional, torn apart by conflicting emotions.&quot; Boomer asks Ellen if she feels any regret for limiting the Cylon by making them as close to humans as possible. Ellen says she gave them free will, the ability to think creatively, to reach out to others with compassion and love. Boomer asks angrily who she should love.

When the Resurrection Hub is destroyed, Cavil and Boomer demand Ellen help them redevelop the technology. Cavil threatens to cut open Ellen's brain in order to access her knowledge, but Boomer spirits her away in a Raptor, telling Ellen she is forgiving her. When they arrive on Galactica, Tyrol identifies her as Boomer and she is immediately taken to the brig.

&quot;Did Boomer really love the Chief? That’s an interesting question and one I don’t have a neat answer to. Boomer is deeply conflicted. I think the process of having false memories planted in her, getting switched “on” as a Cylon, shooting Adama, getting shot by Cally, and her experiences on New Caprica have left her severely disturbed. She was determined to go through with her mission, but in the process of seducing Tyrol she reawakened feelings of love that she thought were dead. I think she experienced real misgivings just before she got on that Raptor, but felt she had gone too far to back down. Wrapped up in that is her perverse envy of Athena, who obtained everything Boomer once wanted, and this festered into a sick desire to strike out at Athena. It’s difficult to say someone who did that loves the Chief, and yet in her damaged way, I think she did and still does love him.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Writer David Weddle discussing the character of Boomer.[2]

The Cylon rebels decide to put her on trial for treason, with capital punishment possible due to the loss of resurrection. When Tyrol goes to see her in the brig, she professes her continued love for him. She shares with him projections of their dream home on Picon, in which they are married and have a daughter. Convinced she will be found guilty and executed, Tyrol helps her escape.&lt;br /&gt;

===Relation of Hera Agathon===

She beats Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon and hides her, bound and gagged, in a bathroom stall. She puts on a pilot uniform and starts cleaning up, however, Karl Agathon finds her before she can leave. Thinking she is his wife Athena who is set to go on a six day mission, he starts seducing her. Boomer tries to leave but then changes her mind and has sex with him. She then picks up Hera from the daycare center and quickly drugs her with a drink. Boomer hides Hera in a provisions supply case to be loaded onto a Raptor. She assures Tyrol she was not lying about what she told him.

&quot;Boomer is much more tragic and conflicted, and in a lot of denial. Athena came from a very different starting point, and everything was a lie, but she fought and made it through the trenches. She's a story not of privilege, but about creating whoever you want to be. That's the American story. Boomer could have been a number of things too, but she made a lot of poor decisions.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Actress Grace Park discussing the characters of Boomer and Athena.[3]

Adama has been alerted Boomer is impersonating Athena and tries to stall her. However, Boomer figures out she has been discovered, and starts powering up her Raptor. Adama warns her he will shoot her down but Boomer tells him she has Hera. Adama starts closing the flight pod but she manages to fly out, clipping her port wing. She then quickly jumps away, close enough to damage Galactica from the resulting spatial disruption. Ellen later concludes everything Boomer did, including helping her escape, was planned in order to kidnap Hera and bring her to Cavil.&lt;br /&gt;

===&lt;br /&gt;Final Death===

Boomer keeps jumping her stolen Raptor headed for The Colony. Hera cries for her mother and Boomer goes to sedate her but cannot bring herself to do it. Instead she tells Hera about her projection of her and Tyrol's home on Picon and Hera surprises her by revealing she can project too and joining her in the projection. Boomer shows Hera the bedroom she dreamed of for her daughter and bonds with the girl. She ultimately takes her to Cavil but has doubts when Hera calls out for her. During the Colonials' assault on The Colony to rescue Hera, Boomer is shocked that Simon continues examining Hera. When he refuses to stop, Boomer kills him and takes Hera to the rescue party and returns her to her parents. Athena does not wish to forgive Boomer, who says she knew it would likely be her last act. She says she owed something to the Admiral, who had not ejected her from the Colonial Fleet when she kept failing to make proper landings. Boomer is then shot and killed by Athena. With the loss of Resurrection, her death is final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Dual Sleeper mode==

The movie Battlestar Galactica: The Plan shows that while she was a sleeper agent aboard Galactica, Boomer had a submerged personality who was aware of her true nature and had a romantic connection to the Brother Cavil aboard the ship, though she was extremely conflicted about her actions. Cavil used an elephant figurine as a trigger to switch Boomer from one mode to the other. This Boomer revealed that she had feelings for Tyrol too and cared deeply for Admiral Adama and stated that she preferred her human personality being in control, that she liked herself better when her main self was in control. This personality blew up the water tank (and came up with the plan to do so) and shot Adama, but she said to do so, she had to mentally make herself a Centurion which deeply disturbed her. After hearing this, Cavil abandoned Boomer to her fate in the brig and this personality never seemed to emerge again. The prostitute Six (and even Tyrol) believes that when she shot Adama, she purposefully didn't kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon==

===Cylon-occupied Caprica===

Another copy of Sharon, who is fully aware of her true nature, also appears in the series. She first appears when she joins then-Lieutenant Karl 'Helo' Agathon after he is stranded on the Cylon-occupied planet Caprica. She pretends to be the &quot;original&quot; Sharon who had returned to help him, when in fact she is working with the other Cylons on an experiment to have him fall in love with her. While her intentions at the beginning of the experiment are strictly part of the Cylon plan, she eventually falls genuinely in love with Helo, and tries to help him escape from the other Cylons. Helo discovers her true identity when he sees another Number Eight copy on Caprica (who attempts to kill him but is shot by Sharon), but Sharon eventually convinces him that she loves him, and also reveals that she is pregnant with his child. This pregnancy is the first known successful attempt at a humanoid-Cylon/Human Hybrid, and as a result is of great importance to the Cylons.

While on Caprica, Sharon and Helo encounter Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace, who realises that Sharon is a Cylon &quot;copy&quot; and attempts to shoot her, but is stopped by Helo. Sharon flees in Starbuck's captured Cylon Raider, casting doubt on her intentions. She returns later to aid Helo and a human resistance movement rescue Starbuck from a Cylon facility. Though only Helo trusts her, the group allows Sharon to accompany them as they rejoin President Laura Roslin's portion of the Colonial fleet, separated from Galactica.&lt;br /&gt;

===&lt;br /&gt;Return to the Colonial Fleet===

Sharon's life is again threatened upon her arrival in the Colonial fleet after William Adama's attempted assassination and Boomer's death. First, Lee 'Apollo' Adama attempts to shoot her until Helo intervenes, then Roslin orders her thrown out an airlock, until Sharon uses her knowledge of the Tomb of Athena on Kobol as leverage. She demonstrates her loyalty several times in defending the group from Cylon ambushes during the trip to the tomb, even though she is chained and not entirely trusted.

Sharon's reunion with other Galactica personnel on Kobol is also tense, as then-Commander Adama initially attempts to strangle her. Her relationship with Tyrol is complicated by the events involving Boomer as well as by her romantic involvement with Helo. Despite Adama's animosity, she saves his life by exposing a plot to kill him by one of terrorist/politician Tom Zarek's followers. She tells them, &quot;I'm Sharon, but I'm a different Sharon. I know who I am. I don't have hidden protocols or programs lying in wait to be activated. I make my own choices, I make my own decisions, and I need you to know this is my choice.&quot; Still, she is imprisoned upon returning to Galactica and treated as an enemy by all but Helo and Tyrol.

When the Galactica is threatened by a Cylon computer virus, Sharon again demonstrates her loyalty by using her Cylon capabilities to instead turn the virus against the large approaching Cylon raider attack force, allowing the Colonial pilots to completely destroy the enemy. Although she performs this action, she seems conflicted and pained by its repercussions (mainly the subsequent slaughter of raiders). This event causes Roslin and Adama to re-evaluate their attitude towards her, and earns her significant trust. She makes several other valuable contributions to the human cause, offering intelligence and advice on various Cylon situations.

When the Battlestar Pegasus is reunited with the Colonial fleet, its commander, Rear Admiral Helena Cain, learns of Sharon's presence. Sharon is turned over to Pegasus's &quot;Cylon Interrogator&quot;, Lt. Thorne, who beats Sharon and attempts to rape her, but is killed when Helo and Tyrol intervene.&lt;br /&gt;

===&lt;br /&gt;Pregnancy and birth===
Sharon's unborn hybrid child is threatened when Roslin orders the pregnancy terminated, outraging Sharon and Helo. Roslin later relents when blood from the fetus is found to be able to cure her terminal cancer. The pregnancy is allowed to continue, and in &quot;Downloaded&quot;, Sharon gives birth to her child prematurely, via an emergency caesarean section. The daughter is named Hera. As the baby is deemed a risk to the Fleet if raised by her Cylon mother, Hera's death is faked by Dr. Cottle. The baby is given to a human mother to raise, unbeknownst to either Sharon or Helo. Told that Hera died from breathing complications, Sharon assumes that Hera was killed by the Galactica crew and attacks Dr. Cottle and turns on Helo. She later helps navigate a mission to rescue survivors on Caprica. Her loyalty is again called into question when she chooses not to inform the Colonials that one of the survivors is a Cylon.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

===Post-occupation of New Caprica===

In Season 3's &quot;Occupation&quot;, it is revealed that during the year-long gap between the events of seasons 2 and 3, Sharon and Helo were married, and Sharon took Helo's surname of Agathon. With the Galactica in need of pilots after the return of the Cylons, and having earned the full trust of Admiral Adama, Sharon is sworn in as an officer in the Colonial Fleet, at Boomer's rank of Lieutenant JG. She is sent back to New Caprica as the liaison between the Galactica fleet and the resistance effort on the ground as a precursor to an attempt to free the subjugated humans from the occupying Cylons. Adama explained that she was the ideal agent, since Centurions cannot tell her from any of the other Eights. Sharon infiltrates the Cylon Base and is able to steal the keys for the civilian ships, thus making Adama's escape plan possible. When leaving with the keys, she encounters a D'Anna Biers, a Number Three, who informs her that her child Hera is still alive. Sharon refuses to believe that Admiral Adama would have lied to her (he in fact had not been told the child was still alive), and shoots D'Anna in the knee to keep her from warning the other Cylons.

After the successful rescue of the colonists, Sharon gains a measure of acceptance among the Galactica's pilots. When Racetrack refers to her by the old call sign 'Boomer,' she replies that 'Boomer' was somebody else. The other pilots in the rec room offer suggestions for a new call-sign. Many of them affectionately tease her for being a Cylon and suggesting names like &quot;Tin Can&quot; and &quot;Titanium&quot;. &quot;Hot Dog&quot; suggests Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, and Sharon proudly accepts it.

Athena displays the ability to identify individual Number Eight copies, identifying Boomer (who shot Admiral Adama at the end of Season 1) when she arrives aboard Galactica to negotiate with Admiral Adama. When Colonel Tigh bars Boomer from the meeting, she repeats Number Three's message that Hera is still alive, but ailing, aboard a basestar. Adama confirms this information in a tense conversation with President Roslin. Both Athena and Helo express feelings of outrage that their child was stolen from them. Athena demands at the end of Season 3 episode 11 that she be able to see her daughter.

As there is no way that Adama would let her visit the Base Ship, Athena asks Helo to shoot her so that she can die and be downloaded onto the Cylon resurrection ship. Caprica Six brings Athena to the room on the Base Ship where Boomer is caring for the child. Athena insists that Hera's illness could be cured by the human doctors on Galactica, a possibility that neither Caprica nor Boomer wishes to consider. Athena and Boomer have a heated discussion regarding the fate of the child. Boomer becomes emotionally unstable and suggests that the experiment be abandoned and Hera killed. Before Athena can intervene, Caprica promptly kills Boomer for considering the death of the child. Before their actions can be discovered, Caprica whisks Athena and Hera to a Raptor, and the trio escape to Galactica.

Athena's abilities as a pilot are recognized and she is given the most important missions for Raptor pilots, including the mission through the star cluster to find a food source after the fleet's food supply is contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;

===&lt;br /&gt;Relation with daughter Hera===

Sharon discovers that she, Hera, President Roslin and Caprica Six are all sharing the same recurring vision of an Opera House but are unaware of what it means.

Athena serves aboard the Demetrius to help Kara Thrace try to find Earth.

Athena shoots and kills Natalie because she sees the Number 6 as a threat to Hera due to the dreams of the Opera House that she has been having. She is placed in the brig by Adama for her actions but is later released, likely because President Roslin and Caprica Six confirmed that they were indeed sharing visions.

Athena, along with Helo and Hera, is part of a group of prisoners captured in the mutiny that are placed in the brig. When rescued, she asks Caprica Six to take Hera and a wounded Helo to safety while she helps Lee Adama and Saul Tigh rescue Bill Adama.

Late in season 4, when Boomer is freed by Tyrol after bringing Ellen Tigh back to the Galactica from the captivity of John Cavil and subsequently being imprisoned by Adama, she seeks out Athena, knocks her unconscious, and steals her uniform. Afterward, Boomer has sexual intercourse with Karl Agathon, who believes she is actually his wife. Athena herself, gagged and barely conscious, watches the scene from a lavatory toilet stall that Boomer put her in, unable to act or react.

In the series finale, after watching the preparations for operation committed upon Hera by a &quot;Simon&quot; Boomer kills him. Boomer brings Hera back to her parents Helo and Athena, knowing she was almost certainly going to be killed. After giving them final assistance, she is shot to death by Athena. After arriving at the New Earth, Helo and Athena joyfully joke with each other as how the two will teach Hera all she needs to know, together.

Hera becomes &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot;, meaning that all modern-day humans are descended from Athena.&lt;br /&gt;

===&lt;br /&gt;Other versions===

A copy joins a group of Twos, Fives, and Sixes at Ragnar Anchorage after Galactica and the fleet depart having stranded &quot;Aaron Doral.&quot; This copy declares that the humans will be hunted down, and a Six replies, &quot;By your command.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;A copy wearing a white coat at the Spaceport at Delphi, whom Athena kills before the other Eight can shoot Helo.&lt;br /&gt;Multiple naked copies aboard the basestar above Kobol, which Boomer was sent to destroy and upon which she learns her identity as a Cylon.&lt;br /&gt;A copy who sits in a movie theatre (with other Cylon models) and watches the footage sent from the Fleet by D'Anna Biers (it can be assumed that it is the same one that Athena shot because she wears the same coat as the above mentioned copy).&lt;br /&gt;Copies who act as &quot;nurses&quot; or &quot;midwives,&quot; aiding the respective resurrections of Caprica Six and Boomer.&lt;br /&gt;Several copies on Cylon-occupied Caprica going through daily life in the episode &quot;Downloaded&quot;, wearing a variety of outfits.&lt;br /&gt;Copies who are killed when Samuel Anders and Galen Tyrol detonate a bomb near a Cylon Heavy Raider.&lt;br /&gt;A copy who sits next to Boomer during a meeting on Colonial One (during the New Caprican occupation), when the suicide bombings are discussed.&lt;br /&gt;Multiple copies aboard the basestar that Caprica Six and Baltar inhabit.&lt;br /&gt;Multiple copies dying aboard a diseased basestar.&lt;br /&gt;A copy, dying from a disease aboard a basestar, who is taken captive by Galactica. Later, she and the rest of the Cylon prisoners are killed by Helo in an attempt to prevent genocide against the Cylons. This copy, despite calling Sharon a traitor, showed typical Eight concern for her and warned her to stay away due to the disease.&lt;br /&gt;Multiple copies who approach Athena on the rebel basestar, asking her to lead a rebellion against the Sixes. Athena expresses disgust with their typical Eight fickleness.&lt;br /&gt;A copy shot and killed by a Centurion while attempting to unplug the Hybrid. She is comforted by Anders in her final moments after Athena refuses to do so.&lt;br /&gt;The Eight copy who had downloaded Athena's memories and helped Helo bring back D'Anna.&lt;br /&gt;The Eights in flight uniforms during the briefing for the attack on the Resurrection Hub.&lt;br /&gt;The multitude of unactivated Eights Helo sees aboard the soon to be destroyed Resurrection Hub.&lt;br /&gt;Two Eights that were on the Raptor with four humans including Felix Gaeta as seen in The Face of the Enemy webisodes. One had a cynical air and was dressed in a black Cylon flight suit, the other was dressed in civilian garb and had an air of innocence. This latter Eight is the one who pretended to collaborate with Felix Gaeta and had an affair with him on New Caprica. The existence of their interactions on New Caprica was also revealed in The Face of the Enemy webisodes. When the Raptor effectively became lost in space due to a malfunction, the &quot;Innocent&quot; Eight murdered the &quot;cynical&quot; Eight and three humans to in order to conserve the air supply for herself and Gaeta. She then revealed to Gaeta that of the people Gaeta had given her a list of to save, most were really murdered by the Cylons just for being important enough to be listed. She intended to spare Gaeta because she loved him, but Gaeta killed her in revenge for the murders she committed on New Caprica and in the Raptor.&lt;br /&gt;Multiple Eights are seen helping repair Galactica in &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot;. One of them is knocked unconscious by Galen Tyrol and substituted for Boomer in the brig. Another is mortally injured in &quot;Islanded in a Stream of Stars&quot; during a major hull breach aboard Galactica; while in sick bay, she asks for Saul Tigh to visit her, and thanks him for the opportunity to meet her &quot;father&quot; (referencing his status as one of the Final Five Cylons) as she dies. Another was prominent at the bedside of Samuel Anders in &quot;Deadlock&quot;, &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; and &quot;Islanded in a Stream of Stars&quot; making some key suggestions like connecting Anders to the Galactica's power systems and the Cylon data stream to attempt to jump start his brain. It failed but that Eight's action led him to eventually becoming the Galactica's hybrid and was instrumental in rescuing Hera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

===Typical Eight traits===

Unlike most other Cylon models, the Eights typically show a great deal of concern and affection towards others. The Eights tend to be the most naive of the models and are often emotionally immature. While capable of convincing manipulation and deception, they are also vulnerable to forming emotional attachments. The Eights also have a propensity for fickleness, often changing loyalties to better suit their own needs and desires, with the notable exception of Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon, whose loyalty to Commander Adama, Helo, and her daughter are unwavering and uncompromising. Moore has also commented that the Eights are more likely to &quot;shoot things they don't like&quot;.

It was revealed by Caprica showrunner Kevin Murphy that the Eights were modeled after Tamara Adama.[4]&lt;br /&gt;

===&lt;br /&gt;Call sign origins===

The call signs for both Sharon characters derive from the names of characters in the original Battlestar Galactica series. Boomer was the name (not the call sign) of a Viper pilot character played by Herbert Jefferson, Jr. Sharon Agathon's call sign, Athena, in the original series was the name of Commander Adama's daughter Lieutenant Athena. Athena was the sister of Captain Apollo, with the duties of bridge officer, shuttle pilot, and occasional Viper pilot.

'''Plot:'''
The episode begins aboard Colonial One with President Roslin randomly drawing the names of five ship captains to appoint as judges for Gaius Baltar's tribunal. Admiral Adama happens to be the fifth name she draws, to her surprise. Aboard Galactica, Admiral Adama looks over Starbuck'spersonnel file and reminisces about the late pilot. In the hangar deck, an inebriated Samuel Anders stands atop a Viper, grieving over Starbuck and causing a scene. Apollo climbs up to offer Anders solace, but Anders says he has to leave. In his uncoordinated state, Anders falls from the Viper and injures his leg.

Meanwhile, Racetrack preps her Raptor to shuttle Baltar's attorney Alan Hughes to the Zephyr. As Hughes boards the Raptor, Racetrack comments negatively about the arrogant lawyer and the fact that she's been assigned as his personal chauffeur. Suddenly, a bomb hidden inside the Raptor explodes, killing Hughes.

On Colonial One, Roslin meets with the press who are concerned of more terrorist attacks. Roslin maintains that she will not let the attack deter in giving Baltar a fair trial. Back aboard Galactica, Apollo conducts a briefing with his pilots, but he is distracted with thoughts of Starbuck. In an embarrassing moment, he comments to a joke told by Racetrack, accidentally calling her Starbuck.

Meanwhile, Roslin and the tribunal judges interview Romo Lampkin, Baltar's replacement counsel who is shown to be a very eccentric individual who constantly wears a blue overcoat and sunglasses. When Roslin asks why he volunteered to be Baltar's legal counsel, possibly risking his life because of it, he claims he's doing it for the &quot;fame.&quot; Everyone is then startled by Lampkin's cat which jumps on Roslin's desk. Lampkin claims the cat belonged to his late wife, and that he brought the animal along in a tote bag.

On Galactica, Admiral Adama questions Apollo's fitness for duty and grounds him from flying until he can get his head straight. In the meantime, he assigns Helo as CAG and puts Apollo in charge of security for Lampkin, much to his son's objection. Apollo meets Lampkin and learns that he was an understudy of his grandfather, Joseph Adama, a man he says he hated. Lampkin requests to see his client Baltar, but chooses Apollo's quarters for the meeting saying Baltar's cell and Lampkin's assigned quarters may be booby trapped or bugged. The meeting is arranged and as Apollo watches, Baltar and Lampkin discuss the trial. Baltar scribbles notes for his manifesto saying the tribunal will use Caprica Six's statements against him.

Lampkin later requests to go to Colonial One, but since Apollo is grounded from flight he asks Athena to shuttle Lampkin and himself over. As Lampkin boards the Raptor, his cat escapes and crawls under the craft. Frustrated, Chief Tyrol stoops down to coax the animal out, but in doing so he finds another bomb attached to the landing gear. Everyone scrambles for safety but the bomb doesn't go off. Later, Admiral Adama admonishes his son for disobeying orders and tells him to remain focused on his duty, regardless of grief for Starbuck. Tyrol conducts an investigation of the latest bomb and reveals that someone on the flight deck crew is the assassin. Cally Tyrol is convinced that it's a Cylon plot and indirectly points the blame at Athena. Her accusation is disregarded, but Athena is outraged asking Cally why she would bomb her own Raptor.

Meanwhile, Lampkin gets approval from Roslin to interview Caprica Six in an interrogation room. Roslin, Tory Foster and Admiral Adama eavesdrop on the conversation from the observation room. During the interview, Six says she will cooperate in prosecuting Baltar, but Lampkin says that Baltar still loves her deeply. He tells her that unlike Baltar, she will not be given a trial. He removes his sunglasses and gives her Baltar's pen saying it was a limited freedom that Baltar gave up for her. Six is moved, but returns the pen saying the guards won't let her have it. In the meantime, Baltar panics in his cell at the mysterious &quot;loss&quot; of his pen.

As Lampkin retires for the evening, Deckhand Figurski gives him a box of paperwork from Colonial One. The marines check the box for sabotage, but then one notices a screw on the deck. As Lampkin enters the code to open his door, the guard shoves him to the ground just as a bomb hidden in the keypad detonates.

Lampkin survives the explosion, but is taken to sickbay. Apollo visits him and brings Lampkin's tote bag, sans the cat, but filled with a curious array of items. When Apollo inquires why he has Roslin's reading glasses, Lampkin says &quot;I borrow things.&quot; He admits to having kleptomania and is compelled to steal &quot;something&quot; from everyone he meets. Lee, however, is exempt; though he debated stealing Starbuck's photo, Lee &quot;has had enough stolen from him already.&quot; Apollo also finds one of the prosecuting lawyers' sandals and a tarnished button from Admiral Adama's uniform. When he comes across a magnet from the previous explosive devices Apollo becomes alarmed. Lampkin says he lifted it off Captain Kelly. Apollo then confronts Kelly who admits he's the bomber. He tells Apollo the only option is to have him locked up for he will continue his attacks as long as Baltar is alive.

In a meeting with Admiral Adama, Apollo is reinstated as CAG and pulled off from the legal counsel for Baltar's trial. Apollo, however, now wishes to help Lampkin; Adama doesn't allow it, saying the job is too risky, and tells Apollo to return to duty. A heated discussion ensues, with Apollo asking Adama if it is an order to return to duty. Adama responds by saying he is through giving Apollo orders. Apollo goes to Memorial Highway and puts Starbuck's photo next to Kat. Anders wanders up on crutches and the two finally come to terms with the loss of Starbuck. Adama returns to the command center, telling the XO to remove Apollo from CAG status, as he has other things to attend to. Meanwhile, Baltar receives an envelope from Lampkin via Apollo which contains his pen and a poetic note stating, ''&quot;There's no greater ally, no force more powerful, no enemy more resolved than a son who chooses to step from his father's shadow.&quot;''

When a [[MAGLEV]] train in [[Caprica City]] is blown up during a [[Soldiers of the One|terrorist]] bombing, two men&amp;mdash;[[Daniel Graystone]], a wealthy computer engineer, and [[Joseph Adama]], a lawyer with roots in the [[Tauron]] mob syndicate called the [[Ha'la'tha]]&amp;mdash;struggle to deal with the loss of their loved ones in the attack. Before the bombing, [[Zoe Graystone]], her friend [[Lacy Rand]] and Zoe's boyfriend [[Ben Stark]] are in the [[holoband]] world at the [[V-Club]] planning their trip to [[Gemenon]], and preparing to meet their new family there. As Daniel becomes increasingly reluctant to accept the loss of his daughter, Zoe, and Joseph the loss of his daughter and wife, [[Tamara Adama|Tamara]] and [[Shannon Adama|Shannon]], it isn't long before their fundamental views about life and death become a source of conflict. Daniel asks if Joseph knows anyone who could help him &quot;obtain&quot; a [[meta-cognitive processor]] invented by Tauron competitor [[Tomas Vergis]] of the [[Vergis Corporation]] to help him complete his prototype robot in time for a demonstration of its capabilities to his military client. At the end of the demonstration when asked what the robot is called, Daniel calls it a [[Cylon]], or Cybernetic Lifeform Node. As a gesture of his gratitude, Daniel creates an avatar of Joseph's daughter [[Tamara (avatar)|Tamara]], which Joseph meets in the holoband world. Daniel then decides to visit the holoband world after discovering what his daughter was doing there. He finds an avatar of [[Zoe (avatar)|Zoe]] and helps her discover what she really is, capturing her and freeing her from the holoband world and uploading her to the Cylon prototype. The Cylon with Zoe works temporarily until a system error between the Cylon and Daniel's work computer causes Daniel to believe that both Zoe and Tamara were lost.

:Thank you for the heads up. I've just taken over as administrator of this wiki, and intend to completely rebuild this wiki with original written content, and assure you that I have no intention of copying pages directly from battlestarwiki.org. I will be taking a different approach to article content, following the example and style of Wookieepedia to hopefully create something very different from battlestarwiki.org. This article will be rewritten as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you notice any more articles like this, please inform me through my talk page so that I can deal with it quickly. - {{Subst:User:Cavalier One/signature}} 10:05, April 9, 2010 (UTC)

'''&quot;Wedge&quot;''' was the callsign of a [[Viper]] [[pilot]] who served on the [[Battlestar]] ''[[Galactica]]''. After the ''Galactica'' and the [[civilian fleet]] had fled the [[Twelve Colonies of Kobol]] following the [[Fall of the Twelve Colonies|assault]] on the [[planet]]s by the [[Cylon]]s, they were relentlessly pursued by [[Basestar]]s for five days. The pursuing Cylon forces appeared every thirty-three minutes, forcing the fleet to constantly jump to avoid destruction, which also resulted in severe sleep deprivation amongst the crew of the ''Galactica'' as pilots were called upon to defend the fleet until the last civilian ship had jumped to safety. After the two hundredth and thirty-eighth jump, the Cylon forces did not appear, ostensibly because the ''[[Olympic Carrier]]'' had been left behind in the escape. With no  pursuit forthcoming, [[Captain]] [[Leland Adama|Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama]] ordered a [[Combat Aerospace Patrol|CAP]] of himself, [[Lieutenant]] [[Kara Thrace|Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace]], and Lieutenant [[Sharon Valerii|Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii]]'s [[Raptor]] to begin patrolling the fleet, followed in three hours by Wedge, alongside [[Winger]] and [[T-Bone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ep33&quot; /&gt;

Happy editing, -- [[User:Sannse|Sannse]]&lt;staff /&gt;  ([[User_talk:Sannse|Talk]]) 13:09, June 2, 2010

== Edits ==

Firstly, welcome! I'm sorry if it seemed I was a little harsh with the reverts, but some of your additions and subtractions didn't make sense to me. For example, the removal of the Male and Female categories, and changing Colonial Fleet personnel to Colonial Fleet Personnel with the addition of a capital letter. The capital isn't needed since only Colonial Fleet is a proper name. Also, the characters category isn't really necessary; as an in-universe wiki, character categories should be replaced with individuals categories.

However, I do agree that a clear category structure is needed. To address your points:

*''The category structure I was mapping out is as follows:
**''One root category for everything on the wiki. Whether it's Category:Browse or Category:Galactica Wiki.''
***Agreed, although it should be Category:Battlestar Galactica Wiki since that is the namespace of the wiki (despite the url saying galactica.wikia.com)
**''In that root category are the main categories - one for each set of information (Category:The New Series or Category:Battlestar Galactica Re-Imagined). There were several''
***I was going with Battlestar Galactica (Re-Imagined Series) and Caprica (Series) in one category with Battlestar Galactica (Original Series) and Galactica 1980 in another for root categories. 
**''Inside each of those, would be the main categories for that series - Category:TNS Characters, Category:Colonial Fleet, Category:TNS Ships, Category:TNS Episodes etc
***Character categories should be individuals categories in my opinion - I've used them on several other wikis and it helps to give the wiki a sense of in-universe narrative. Episodes should be listed by full series name.
**''I had a structure set out for the colonial fleet etc, since these had their names mixed up. The &quot;Colonial Fleet&quot; should refer to the whole military (before and after the attacks), separate to the civilian ships that form &quot;The Fleet&quot;.''
***No problems there. I believe I kept the entire The Fleet category and didn't change it?
**''Within those categories would be sub-categories again for relevant things. So in characters would be cylons/humans/humanoidcylons/males/females etc. In Colonial Fleet would be ships/personnell/officers/pilots etc. In Episodes would perhaps be a subcategory for each season.''
***''Agreed, although some categories such as pilots are not limited solely to the Colonial Fleet. There are civilian pilots, and Cylon pilots for instance. As for episodes, check ''[[33]]'' for an example of what I'm aiming for.
**''Note that I added TNS/TRS when there would be the same article in TOS. If there wouldn't be the same article, then there's no need for the TNS/TRS prefix. However, I also thought it would be good for this wiki to focus on one or the other - so Category:Ships would refer to TNS/TRS rather than TOS or both; and any TOS articles/categories would be marked as TOS. That way, only one of them has to have a prefix, and it makes using the wiki a lot easier.
**''For the names, the reason I chose to (temporarily) use &quot;The New Series&quot; (TNS) rather than &quot;Re-imagining&quot; is because it's more obvious to new visitors, it's more obvious what it means, it's easy to remember (and guess), easier to type, and it's consistent accross every category and page name. Having a combination of &quot;Re-imagined&quot; and &quot;Re-imagining&quot; and &quot;Reimagined&quot; and &quot;Re-Imagined&quot; and &quot;TRS&quot; etc makes life very awkward.
***The reason I'm not using abbreviations and the like is that I'm trying to consciously not use the layouts and abbreviations that the non-Wikia Battlestar Wiki uses. I'm trying to standardise it as Re-Imagined Series for this wiki. Sure it takes a while to type, but we have a smart category function. In terms of layout, I want to aim for a more Wookieepedia-style in-universe documenting of the BSG worlds.
**''If you disagree, could you suggest what you think the best layout would be? Before I edited, there were some duplicate categories and other problems, so even if you don't adopt my suggestion, there needs to be some sort of decision.''
***I keep finding duplicate cats and other problems, so feel free to let me know where they are. I'm not against your suggestions; I think we both have similar goals here, but differing ideas on how to get there. I truly believe that this wiki can be ressurected, and have a unique feel, different from Battlestar Wiki and more in line with other successful Wikia projects. Also, I like the image you made for the logo. I'll be putting it up as soon as I've typed this. I meant to do it yesterday, but forgot. - [[User:Cavalier One|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''Cavalier One'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[File:Logo.jpg|20px]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Cavalier One|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;''Wireless''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 14:27, June 4, 2010 (UTC)

*Sorry for the long wait for a reply - have been a little busy of late. I see that the capitalisation is personal preference on the wikis you administrate; in the same way, using proper naming conventions for categories is my preference, and how it is done on the wikis I administrate (Wookieepedia, Harry Potter Wiki, Firefly and Serenity Database, Discworld), which I believe in turn follows the original Wikipedia way of naming categories. The &quot;smart&quot; category system in the Monaco skin allows for quick addition of categories in any case.
*As for the namespace; that's Wikia's (or the original creator of this Wiki's) doing. I think it is possible to request a change, but I'm not entirely sure if it's necessary. We'll have to do a lot of work to outstrip the Battlestar Wiki in terms of page hits and google rankings, so keeping the full name would be preferable I think.
*You're right about the length of the category for episodes. I'm not really a fan of using TRS, or TNS for them since I think its too close to Battlestar Wiki's naming convention, but here's an alternative: We use '''Battlestar Galactica episodes''' for all episode relating to the ''Original Series'', '''Galactica 1980 episodes''' for ''Galactica 1980'', '''BSG season # episodes''' or '''BSG season #''' for the Re-Imagined Series, and '''Caprica season # episodes''' or '''Caprica season #''' for Caprica. Thoughts? - [[User:Cavalier One|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''Cavalier One'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[File:Logo.jpg|20px]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Cavalier One|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;''Wireless''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 13:10, June 11, 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3383">Now I tell my story as my brother Orion wrote it long ago. Enjoy.

Orion has tried to keep his many family members secret. His younger brother Apollo Blastar for example is starting up StarStriker Industries with many others. But the black sheep of the Blastar family is the red headed Eris Blastar. Named after the Greek Goddess of Discord/Chaos for a reason. No man or woman can tell her what to do and nobody can seem to control her.

When she was 9 and Orion was 5, a 9 year old bully picked on Orion at School. Eris is overprotective of her brother Orion and beat the bully into a pulp and told him that &quot;You are a retard who just got his butt kicked by a girl. Leave my brother alone or I'll come back to finish the job.&quot; That bully's father later paid the Blastar household a visit and talked to their father who stated &quot;Eris cannot be controlled and she has the worst temper problem we've ever seen due to the McCoy gene.&quot; the bully's father said &quot;Then I will give her the beating she deserves!&quot; and Eris' father said &quot;Oh no, don't do that, you'll only make her worse.&quot; To which Eris said to the bully's father &quot;I'll give you two options mister, either you can lose the attitude and walk out the front door, or I'll throw you out the window.&quot; The bully's father said &quot;Little girl there is nothing you can do to me, you're a pipsqueek and I weigh 250 pounds mostly muscle.&quot; and laughed at her. He then tried to swing at Eris, but she grabbed his fist and threw him out the window and yelled &quot;Enjoy your stay at the hospital, retard, like your spoiled son, you too got your butt kicked by a girl!&quot; as the bully's father was all cut up by glass and knocked out as he landed on his head.

Eris Blastar continued her quest for power and studied every fighting style there was to learn. She got the attention of the one true God and he granted her Angel powers to fight the many Gods and Goddesses he claimed were false Gods and needed to be beaten. He granted her energy and matter manipulation powers, a hyper quantum computer mind to figure out every angle of battle and every probability, the ability to grant and remove powers even for herself and duplicate powers and beings by seeing their energy signature and DNA. She stole the powers of the Greek Goddess Eris and then granted them back to her keeping a copy of those powers for herself. After deciding she didn't like being told by God what to do and that nobody should tell her what to do she rebelled and became a fallen angel but made a promise with God not to fight him but to fight demons, devils, Gods, Goddesses, and other beings who threaten the many universes and watch over her brother Orion like a guardian angel. Orion claims he can take care of himself now, but nobody tells Eris what to do and she does as she pleases.

Daniel was the seventh Cylon model created by the Final Five, as revealed in the episode &quot;No Exit&quot;. Ellen referred to Daniel as an &quot;artist, and so sensitive to the world&quot;. She was very close to Daniel, which enraged Cavil; he felt that Daniel was Ellen's favorite child and became jealous. Cavil poisoned the amniotic fluid being used to mature the Daniel copies and then corrupted Daniel's genetic code. This sabotage meant that no further Daniel copies could be created - an elimination more permanent than the later model-wide boxing of the Number Threes. The Sevens were not mentioned again during Battlestar Galactica's remaining episodes. Because of the destruction of this model line, there were twelve models active throughout the series rather than thirteen.

Because of the nature of the character(s), fans began to speculate that Kara Thrace was a version of the corrupted Seven line, or that her father was. Ronald D. Moore stated in the podcast for &quot;Islanded in a Stream of Stars&quot; that Daniel is merely a plot device to explain the missing number and to expand on Cavil's character (noting that Daniel is essentially the Abel to Cavil's Cain). In the podcast for &quot;No Exit&quot;, Moore described the Sevens as a springboard for Caprica, the BSG prequel, where Daniel Graystone is the name of a main character played by Eric Stoltz; this Daniel is the creator of the Colonial Centurions.

Number Sevens are never seen in the series, and therefore not played by any actor</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1494">[[Doctor]] '''Amarak''' was a male [[scientist]] who was a colleague of Doctor [[Gaius Baltar]]'s at the [[Colonial Ministry of Defense]] before the [[Fall of the Twelve Colonies]].

Five days after the [[civilian fleet]] left the orbit of [[Ragnar Anchorage]], an individual claiming to be Amarak contacted ''[[Colonial One]]'', requesting a meeting with [[President]] [[Laura Roslin]]. He indicated that he had vital information regarding how [[Cylon]] forces were able to bypass and shut down Colonial defenses during their assault on the [[Colonies]].

However, the ship he was on, the ''[[Olympic Carrier]]'' was suspected of having been taken over by Cylons when it failed to make an [[FTL jump]] with the rest of the fleet, only to appear later. In order to protect the fleet, the ''Olympic Carrier'' was destroyed by [[Captain]] [[Leland Adama]] and [[Lieutenant]] [[Kara Thrace]] under the orders of both the president, and [[Commander]] [[William Adama]]. Doctor Amarak was presumed dead in the explosion.

==Behind the scenes==
Amarak was first referred to in the episode ''[[33]]'', the first episode of the [[Battlestar Galactica Season 1|first season]] of ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''. Whether or not Amarak actually survived the destruction of the Colonies, or if his name was merely being used by the Cylons for their own gain, is unclear.

{{Ship}}

The '''Columbia''' was a [[Battlestar]] that belong to the same class as the Galactica, even though it carried more armor than did the [[Galactica]]. During [[Operation Raptor Talon]] in the [[First Cylon War]], it along with Galactica and one unnamed Battlestar attacked a [[Cylon Base]] on an unnamed [[ice planet]] where the Columbia was destroyed with all hands.

A second Columbia would be built after the [[Cylon War]]. See [[Columbia]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="804">[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]]
''Defiance'' is the name of a ''Charybdis'' class Dreadstar, and the title warship in my fanfic novel (work in progress) on Fan Fiction, about other Colonial survivors having escaped the destruction of the Colonies and who are looking for a new homeworld or other remnants of humankind to join with.

The Commander of Defiance is Valeria Novaska, a Virgon.  She is nearly fifty and has an addiction to a certain high-caffiene drink called &quot;Green Tyger&quot;.  Her estranged husband, known only as &quot;Jojo&quot; was killed in the Cylon onslaught.  She has no children, having been so consumed by her career that she simply... forgot.

''Defiance'' carries two Viper squadrons, the ''Snakes'', and the ''Long Knives'', plus a Raptor squadron, the ''Puking Daggits''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3486">Part 2

As Anders and Tory continue to hear the strange music and begin making love, Chief Tyrol is awakened by the music. Both he and Colonel Tigh begin their own searches for its source, but neither can find it. On the hangar deck, Anders realizes that Tyrol is humming the strange music, and the two agree that it sounds like something from childhood.

After receiving an injection for her cancer treatments in sickbay, Roslin has another vision of the opera house on Kobol. Also in sickbay, Sharon enters the same vision while holding Hera in her arms and both women wake up screaming. Sharon confirms having shared the experience and likens it to the Cylon ability of &quot;projection.&quot; They proceed to question Caprica Six in her cell, and immediately discover that she was in the same dream. Caprica talks of feeling compelled to protect Hera.

The trial resumes and Gaeta takes the witness stand. He perjures himself by saying that Baltar willingly signed the death order to have Roslin, Zarek, and others executed. Rather than attempting to prove this during cross-examination, however, Lampkin acts on Lee Adama's suggestion and moves for a mistrial, based on prejudicial statements Admiral Adama had made to Lee concerning Baltar's guilt and the trial's outcome. Lee then takes the witness stand, but refuses to testify against his father, instead returning to Lampkin's original line of argument that Baltar, for all his failings, could not be faulted for the tragedy on New Caprica.

By a vote of 3 to 2, the tribunal finds him not guilty and the courtroom erupts in furor. His service having been completed, Lampkin abandons Baltar. Reflecting on the trial, Baltar wonders how he will survive. In CIC, Admiral Adama admits to Roslin's dissatisfaction that he was one of the &quot;not guilty&quot; voters.

When the fleet makes the final jump into the Ionian Nebula, Roslin feels faint and a few seconds later all of the ships suffer a power outage and drift. The Galactica crew struggles to restore power. Moving through the darkness and trying to hide his face, Baltar is suddenly surrounded by three people, including the woman who had asked him to bless her child. They take him to what they tell him is &quot;[his] new life.&quot;

Caprica Six returns again to the opera house and sees herself, Baltar and Hera looking up at the glowing, robed apparitions of the Final Five Cylons looking down on them from a balcony. Compelled by their own shared auditory hallucination, Tory, Colonel Tigh, Tyrol, and Anders converge on the Galactica gym, where they all hum the melody together, then sing the lyrics, and come to the distressing conclusion that they are all Cylons. When power is restored, DRADIS identifies four Cylon basestars bearing down on the fleet and Admiral Adama orders general quarters. All of the newly discovered Cylons return to their posts but are wary of what they might do. As the other pilots scramble to their ships, Lee returns to his locker to grab his flight gear, despite having been removed from flight status.

After launch, Apollo separates from the other Vipers to chase a new DRADIS contact in the nebula. The contact turns out to be Starbuck; she tells a surprised Apollo that she has found Earth, and that she will lead them there.

As the Cylon and Galactica fleets prepare for battle, the camera zooms out (to show the entire galaxy), and zooms back (also with a 2D rotation of 180 degrees clockwise) in elsewhere in the galaxy to show a single planet: Earth.</text>

== Pages ripped off from battlestarwiki.org ==

Hi, You may know about the existence of battlestarwiki.org. Apparently the licensing used there is CC BY-NC-SA which is not the not compatible with the one used by Wikia. I have found that some of the pages here are a direct rip off, and a few other pages have large sections copied over. I request you, you being one of the most recent editor, to remove or edit the content so that it stays acceptable as per Creative Commons. I have provided a list of pages which are in violation. Other pages also might be in violation.

=== These pages are a complete copy ===
* [[New Caprica]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/New_Caprica
* [[Pegasus]] from http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Pegasus_(RDM)

=== These pages have large sections copied over ===
* http://galacticafanon.wikia.com/wiki/Humanoid_Cylon

* [[Battle of New Caprica]]

[[Special:Contributions/92.96.152.243|92.96.152.243]] 08:28, August 13, 2011 (UTC)

I fixed some of it, but I can't fix the fanon site since I'm not on there. I've just started here, once it starts growing, it'll all dissapear. [[User:Uditore|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:trajan pro;font-size:15px;color:darkred;&quot;&gt;'''Uditore'''&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User_Talk:Uditore|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:verdana;font-size:15px;color:pink;&quot;&gt;™&lt;/span&gt;]] 12:59, August 13, 2011 (UTC)

Thanks for the quick response. I would also like to welcome you over to contribute also to battlestarwiki.org, if only you like to join us. Remember you are also welcome there always. [[Special:Contributions/92.96.152.243|92.96.152.243]] 15:44, August 13, 2011 (UTC)</text>

This is a timeline of all the events in the history of [[Humans|humanity]] and [[Cylons]].

==Galactica==
*During the [[First Cylon War]], Galactica was built to represent the [[Caprica]] colony.
*During the First Cylon War, Galactica along with the [[Columbia]] and one other unnamed Battlestar tooks part in [[Operation Raptor Talon]]; where the Columbia is destroyed with all hand.
*Many years after the war, Galactica was one of the oldest ships in the fleet, and was scheduled to be decommissioned and turned into a museum. Various conversions were taking place and most of her onboard squadrons were removed.
*During the decommissioning ceremony, the cylon attacks on the colonies began. After a battle, including many direct strikes, Galactica successfully [[Jumping|jumped]] away to the [[Ragnar Anchorage]] depot.
*Galactica then leads and defends a small fleet of civilian ships on the search for resources and a new place to settle.

:Uhm, sorry, you might inform [[User:Uditore]] of this. I am simply helping her out a little here, and I myself haven't watched any of the series. She will be able to rewrite those sections. -- [[User:Master Sima Yi|Master Sima Yi]] 10:02, August 13, 2011 (UTC)</text>

'''Earth''' was the colony world of the thirteenth tribe of [[Kobol]]. It was a technologically backward world, and equivalent to the real life Earth of that time.

Before reaching Earth, the thirteenth tribe laid down several colonies along the path to Earth, one being [[Terra]], a much more technologically advanced world than Earth.

==Earth (RDM)==

'''William Adama''': ''What have I done? All the people I've sent to die, for what? For what?''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lee''': ''For Earth.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Adama''': ''There is no Earth. It's a frakking joke. There is no Earth.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lee''': ''Okay, Dad, listen to me. Listen to me! Pull it together.''&lt;br /&gt;
--[[Leland Adama|Lee]] trying to sober up a drunken [[William Adama]].

'''Earth''' is the name for the planets seen as a &quot;home&quot;.

===First Earth===
[[File:Roslin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Laura Roslin]] on the destroyed Earth.]]

The first Earth had long been destroyed before [[the Fleet]] could reach it. Radiation measurements of the water and ground showed that the planet had gone through a nuclear event long ago, and that it was once inhabited by [[humanoid Cylons]] and [[Centurions|mechanical Cylons]] before this event. The planet was tainted with destruction, debris of fallen structures as far as the eye could see. The members of the Fleet declared the planet uninhabitable, and went back to their ships in search of another planet to call home.

===Second Earth===
[[File:Battlestar-galactica-s04e22-daybreak-part-2-010014-tigh-cottle-adama-hoshi-and-baltar-on-earth.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Some of Galactica's crew exploring Earth.]]
'''Adama''': ''Earth is a dream...one we've been chasing for a long time. We've earned it. This is Earth.''&lt;br /&gt;
--Adama trying to convince Roslin that this the real Earth.

The second Earth was already inhabited by a vast amount of creatures and was covered by lush grass landscapes. Tribal human beings were the primal life forms on this planet, having the same DNA set up as the humans of the Fleet, providing a perfect match for breeding and thus the survival of the human race. It was here that [[Hera Agathon]] grew up and started the supposed maternal lineage for all humans in the following decades.

Many centuries later, in modern times, scientists had dug up the fossil of their so-called Mitochondrial Eve. The civilisation of that time was in a technologic boost, already capable of making simple robots.

'''Laura Roslin''': ''Doctor, I need your help. But it's illegal, dangerous and in violation of your oath as an officer.''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Dr. Cottle''': ''You're a lousy salesman.''&lt;br/&gt;
--Cottle and Roslin conversing.&lt;br/&gt;

'''Sherman Cottle''', frequently named '''Doc Cottle''', was the Chief Medical Officer of the [[Galactica]].

==Biography==

===Known patients===
*[[Laura Roslin]]
*[[William Adama]]
*[[Sharon Agathon]]
*[[Number Six]]
*[[Felix Gaeta]]

===Crew members===
*Layne Ishay
*Howard Kim

==Personality and characteristics==

Hi, welcome to Battlestar Galactica Wiki. Thanks for your edit to the '''User talk:Cavalier One''' page.

== Copyvios ==

Sorry of the late reply. I am more active on other wikis that needed my attention. I believe I've dealt with the queries you raised - although I must admit to not seeing any direct relation between the two Humanoid cylon articles. Perhaps you can point out exactly where they are copied over? Also, if you find any such pages in the future, feel free to strip the copied content out yourself with a note in the edit summary. It is not the wish of this wiki to copy content, and we would like to create original articles. - [[User:Cavalier One|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''Cavalier One'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[File:Logo.jpg|20px]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Cavalier One|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;''Wireless''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 09:30, August 16, 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8482">'''Gina Inviere'''&lt;ref&gt;The name &quot;Gina&quot; is never spoken in the series until the television special &quot;Razor&quot; . However, before that, Ron Moore used the name throughout the podcasts for the episodes where Inviere appears, and the name was widely used by fans and news writers. Her surname was not introduced even behind-the-scenes until &quot;Razor&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; is the alias (&quot;inviere&quot; is Old Gemenese for &quot;resurrection&quot;) of a [[Number Six]] copy who poses as a systems analyst aboard the battlestar ''Pegasus''.

Two years prior to the attack on the Colonies, she served as a handler of sorts for Sharon Valerii . Inviere walks her through her upcoming integration into Colonial society and reassures her that it will be just like resurrecting, and that when she awakens she'll be a whole other person.

She resurfaces several months before the attack on the Twelve Colonies, in the employment of Integral Systems Engineering. She presents a proposal for the retrofit of ''Pegasus'' to the Ministry of Defense and worked out the details of the CNP upgrade with Admiral Cain directly. During that time, the two grew close and eventually started having a relationship. They try to be discreet in front of the crew, but don't make it a secret either.

Working alongside Kendra Shaw on ''Pegasus'', Inviere manages to gain the officer's trust and use of her personal access codes.

Shortly after the attack on the Colonies, Inviere is instrumental in finding a Cylon communications relay - which turns out to be a staging grounds with squadrons of Raiders far in excess of what the Colonials expected. During the ensuing battle, she helps a boarding party of Centurions gain access to the ship, which leads to many casualties.

When Shaw encounters another Six, she realizes that Inviere is a Cylon and unmasks her in CIC. Inviere kills two Marines but hesitates to kill Cain, indicating that her feelings for Cain are in fact genuine, and is knocked unconscious by Shaw just as she is about to pull the trigger. Inviere is then taken into custody.

With the destruction of mankind's homeworlds and Inviere's personal betrayal and manipulation fresh in mind, Admiral Cain quickly suppresses her feelings for Inviere, and no longer treats her as a human being, but a thing. She orders Lieutenant Thorne to interrogate Inviere and to employ &quot;degradation, fear, [and] shame&quot; while being as creative as he needs to be. Thorne employs whippings in his torture sessions and, along with other male crew, gang rapes her, reducing Inviere to a nearly catatonic state, but ultimately fails to gain any intelligence.

When ''Pegasus'' encounters ''Galactica'' and her Fleet, Inviere is examined by Dr. [[Gaius Baltar]]. He is heartbroken by her state, and resolves to help her in any way he can. He convinces Admiral [[Helena Cain]] to permit her to be fed, and recounts to Inviere the story of his love for her copy on Caprica, before the Cylon attack.

Inviere, speaking for the first time in many months, tells Baltar that she was not a sleeper agent; she was fully aware of her mission and expected to be killed and resurrect back among the Cylons after carrying it out, but instead was subjected to horrific torture by the ''Pegasus'' crew. She begs Baltar to kill her and put an ultimate end to her suffering. Baltar reminds her that she would just be resurrected in another Number Six body somewhere else. No longer wishing to live in any form, Inviere betrays her fellow Cylons in order to fulfill her personal death wish. She reveals to Baltar that she won't download if the unknown Cylon ship that ''Pegasus'' is tracking is destroyed.

She calls the vessel a Resurrection Ship, and that it was used to collect the consciousnesses of Cylons who die too far away from the Cylon homeworld and download them into new bodies. With no Resurrection Ship to download her consciousness, Inviere would truly die if she were killed, as would any other Cylon in ''Galactica'''s fleet or the Cylon fleet pursuing them.

When she senses that the Resurrection Ship is destroyed, Inviere begs Baltar to kill her. She is incapable of killing herself, because within the Cylon religion, suicide is a mortal sin. However, Baltar convinces Inviere that she should go on living and get &quot;justice&quot; for what happened to her. With Baltar's help, Inviere escapes from her cell, makes her way to Cain's quarters and shoots Cain with a pistol, killing her. She then somehow manages to escape ''Pegasus''.&lt;ref&gt;As did Shelly Godfrey, Inviere knows how to navigate through a battlestar without being detected, including escaping from one, since Godfrey also disappears from ''Galactica''. It is possible that Baltar helped her escape, but this is fanwanking.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Laura Roslin]] finds herself on her death bed, Demand Peace — a movement seeking peace with the Cylons — summons Baltar to ''Cloud Nine''. Inviere has assumed a leading role within the peace movement, her followers unaware of her Cylon nature. She disguises herself by means of glasses and a different hairstyle. Inviere attempts to convince Baltar that, upon assuming the presidency, he should go up against Adama -- and thus solidify the distrust of the military within the Fleet.

Because of the extreme sexual abuse she suffers on ''Pegasus'', and atypical of her model, Inviere now abhors intimate contact, as observed when she bites Baltar as he instinctively tries to kiss her. After Roslin recovers from her cancer -- thanks to Baltar's perceived unappreciated efforts -- Baltar gives Inviere the nuclear warhead earmarked for Baltar's research as part of his Cylon detect.

Following Baltar's election as president of the Twelve Colonies, he visits Inviere once more aboard ''Cloud Nine'', attempting to explain to her that because of his new duties he'd be unable to see as much of her as they'd like. After he remarks that he'd make what time he could on New Caprica, she tells him that she wouldn't be leaving the ship to join the new colony. Angry, Baltar attempts to leave the room, but Inviere simply says &quot;stay,&quot; while proceeding to undress, choking back her physical aversion in a desperate attempt to make him stay with her. They share an intimate interlude.

While Baltar is being sworn in as president, Inviere sits naked on the floor of her room in front of the nuclear warhead. The timer running, The Cylon once known as Gina Inviere cries softly as the device detonates, blowing up herself, ''Cloud Nine'' and several ships in the vicinity. One year later, the radiation signature from this explosion leads the Cylons to New Caprica, beginning an occupation of the planet.

Despite there apparently being a second Resurrection Ship in range of the Fleet not long before her death (''Galactica'' Cavil tells his Caprica counterpart there's a ship in range), her death is apparently final. Presumably the ship was out of range by that time as the Cylons stopped their pursuit of the Fleet and didn't know where New Caprica was.

==Notes==
*Gina is a reference to some fans' derisive nickname for the Re-imagined Series, GINO meaning &quot;''Galactica'' In Name Only&quot;. This itself is an allusion to RINO and DINO, both derogatory political terms used in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_rdm_podcast|episode=Pegasus|act=2|id=GINO|timestamp=|totalrunning=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In real life, &quot;înviere&quot; is Romanian for &quot;resurrection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websters-dictionary-online.org/translation/Romanian/inviere|title=Webster's Online Dictionary|accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gina has darker hair than the Number Six copies seen before her. It is unknown whether she has naturally white hair which she dyes honey-blonde, or other Sixes have naturally honey-blonde hair which they dye white. When Caprica-Six is reborn in &quot;[[Downloaded]]&quot;, her hair is white. In &quot;Torn&quot;, a Six with even darker, raven-black, hair appears. Other Sixes with darker hair than the norm seen later include Natalie Faust, Lida in &quot;Blood on the Scales&quot;, and Tough Six in &quot;The Plan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cinematically, actor [[Tricia Helfer]]'s hair was dyed in the lighter color in Season 1. However, the dye caused damage to her hair, so wigs are used later. The hair color of Gina is the actress's natural color.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gina was supposed to appear in a subplot in &quot;Downloaded&quot; in which she conspires with [[D'Anna Biers]] to kidnap Hera. However, the episode ran long and all of the scenes involving the scheme were cut.

'''Number Three''', also known as '''D'Anna Biers''', is a model of humanoid Cylon, female, blonde, and marked by a religious curiosity—notably surrounding the verboten Final Five—that sets her against the other Cylon models, notably the Number Ones.

The model was first introduced in &quot;Final Cut&quot; as an infiltrator in the Fleet under the alias &quot;D'Anna Biers&quot; posing as a reporter for the Fleet News Service. She appears to be more of a tabloid rumor-and-innuendo format news journalist and less of the conventional Fleet journalist types such as James McManus.

Threes are also referred to as &quot;D'Annas&quot; collectively.

Because of their defiance of the taboo against learning more about the Final Five, the entire line is boxed, and their consciousnesses are stored at the Cylons' central Resurrection Hub.

Natalie's faction in the Cylon Civil War wants to unbox the Number Three who visited the Temple of Five, so that the seven and the five may be united. They eventually forms a fragile alliance with the Colonials to retrieve this Three, and then destroy the Hub. Three is resurrected, and with the destruction of the Hub she becomes the sole Three in existence.

Fallen into despair with the discovery of a dead Earth, this last Three chooses to stay and die on the planet.

==Copies==
===[[D'Anna Biers (Fleet copy)]]===
[[File:D'Anna_Biers_(Fleet_copy).jpg|thumb|left|230px|Number Three model on ''Galactica'' (Final Cut).]]
The first copy of Number Three is introduced in &quot;Final Cut&quot;, posing as a documentary filmmaker chronicling the &quot;Gideon massacre&quot; and, later, life aboard Galactica. Her report is transmitted back to Cylon-occuped Caprica, along with information on Sharon Agathon neé Valerii's survival and successful pregnancy.

Her status following the arrival of the Cylons on New Caprica is uncertain; it is not clear whether the lead Number Three who interacts with Baltar and later Hera is the same copy as the filmmaker.

This copy is presumed deceased, as she is more than likely boxed with her entire line and her consciousness destroyed with the Resurrection Hub.

===[[D'Anna Biers (Downloaded copy)]]===
[[File:D'Anna_Biers_(Downloaded_copy).jpg|thumb|230px|Number Three model on ''Caprica'' (Downloaded).]]
This Number Three is first introduced in &quot;Downloaded&quot; in her attempt to box Caprica-Six and Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii. After the two Cylons convince the others that they made a mistake when they launched their all-out attack on the Colonies, she later oversees the occupation of New Caprica, the recovery of Hera Agathon from Colonial hands, and later leads the Cylons' search for both Earth and the Final Five.

This later search for the Final Five, verboten by a cultural imperative of Cylon society, leads her to the Temple of Five where she receives a vision that identifies the Five. She later dies as a result of this vision, only to be resurrected and summarily boxed, a process overseen by the Number Ones. However, a Cylon Civil War instigated by Natalie (a Number Six) leads to her later unboxing by Cavil and Boomer, with the belief that she can convince the rebels to stop rebelling. She offers her rather violent reply to this (by killing Cavil), and is summarily rescued by Karl Agathon and an Eight, and—with the destruction of the Resurrection Hub—is the last Three in existence and the only Three to ever reach Earth.

===Other copies===
A Number Three demonstrates her oratorical skills by giving a speech at the graduation ceremony of the New Caprica Police and is blown up shortly afterwards, along with many of the other attendees, by Tucker &quot;Duck&quot; Clellan, whom she has just congratulated.

Later on, two Threes form part of the Cylon counsel in the command center of a baseship, where they first learn of the virus which threatened to infect their ship. After Baltar returns with further information from the baseships, one of the Threes makes the decision to abandon the infected baseship to its fate, angering the Hybrid.

A Number Three on another baseship repeatedly taunts and tortures Daniel Novacek prior to his seeming escape. Novacek &quot;kills&quot; this copy, which is allegedly diseased, and makes his &quot;escape&quot; to the Fleet. However, this was all part of a Cylon plan for Novacek to take revenge on William Adama, and his exit is observed by another Three, who laughs mockingly.

Another Number Three refuses the Cylon consensus that the fleet of Heavy Raiders carrying D'Anna Biers and Gaius Baltar to the algae planet must be told to stand down. Instead, she gives the return order to all the craft except the one with Biers and Baltar on it, reasoning that Admiral Adama would never destroy the Temple of Five and kill his own people over just one ship. This incident makes it clear to the other models that Biers no longer cares about consensus, and that the other Threes are with her.

All Number Threes are subsequently boxed. Biers herself is revived during the Battle of the Resurrection Hub, and all the other copies are lost with the destruction of the Resurrection Hub. Since she is the last, her death marks the extinction of her model.</text>

Is a revitalised and reimaged version of the science-fiction warefare based Battlestar Galactica (1978 series). The series ended with four seasons in 2009 and a underway up-coming continuation series has been in motion since 2009/2010 and it is rumored to be aired in 2012. The series is called Battlestar Galactica: Blood &amp; Chrome.




==Plot/Storyline==
In this series we follow a human battleship in deep space known as [[Battlestar Galactica]]. The ship is fleeing a relentless attack to wipe out the entire human race implemented by their own created AI beings known as [[Cylon]]s. The Battlestar accompanies and protects what they assume to be the last 50,000 people in existence after a quickly executed genocidal attack on all 12 Human Colonies, in which the Cylons were almost completely successful, though completely successful in occupying (Killing any found survivors). With low supplies, no allies, and little hope the entire convey venture into uncharted space to flee the onslaught in hopes to find refuge among the stars. Their destination is the fabled 13th Colony of [[Earth]], founded by a tribe said to have left the Human origin planet of [[Kobol]] &quot;early on&quot; before any other tribes or the founding of the [[Twelve Colonies of Kobol|12 colonies]].

Series overview

Battlestar Galactica continued from the 2003 miniseries to chronicle the journey of the last surviving humans from the Twelve Colonies of Kobol after their nuclear annihilation by the Cylons. The survivors are led by President [[Laura Roslin]] and Commander [[William Adama]] in a ragtag fleet of ships with the Battlestar Galactica, an old but powerful warship, as its command ship. Pursued by Cylons intent on wiping out the remnants of the human race, the survivors travel across the galaxy looking for the fabled and long-lost &quot;thirteenth&quot; colony: Earth. Unlike most space opera series, Battlestar Galactica has no aliens (the antagonists are man-made Cylon robots), the primary armaments used by both military forces utilize bullets, rail guns, and missiles instead of lasers, and the series intentionally avoids technobabble.Instead, most of the stories deal with the apocalyptic fallout of the destruction of the Twelve Colonies upon the survivors, and the moral choices they must make as they deal with the decline of the human race and their war with the Cylons. Stories also portray the concept of perpetuated cycles of hate and violence driving the human-Cylon conflict, and religion, with the implication of a &quot;God&quot; whose angelic agents appear to certain main characters (most notably [[Gaius Baltar]]).

Over the course of the show's four seasons, the war between the Colonials and the Cylons takes many twists and turns. Despite the animosity on both sides, the human and a faction of the Cylons eventually form an uneasy alliance, in the wake of the Cylon Civil War. The Cylon leader, humanoid Cylon &quot;Number One&quot; named John Cavil precipitated the schism in the Cylon ranks. Cavil deceives the other models by obsessively hiding the identities and origins of the remaining five humanoid Cylon models, the &quot;Final Five&quot;, who, known only to him, are a more ancient type of Cylon, created by a previous iteration of human civilization. Other plotlines involve the mysterious destiny of [[Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace]], who is the subject of a prophecy claiming that she is the &quot;Harbinger of Death&quot; who will &quot;lead them all [humanity] to its end,&quot; as well as the redemption of Gaius Baltar through the Cylons' monotheistic religion, after he becomes a pariah within the fleet.

In the final episodes, a divinely resurrected Kara Thrace leads the surviving humans and their Cylon allies to a new planet, which Adama names &quot;Earth&quot;. The first group of survivors settle in ancient Africa. The &quot;real&quot; Earth that the Colonials had searched for during their years in space was revealed in an earlier episode to have been originally inhabited thousands of years before by a previous form of humanoid Cylons. Ironically, these humanoid Cylons created their own Centurion robotic slaves, who waged a nuclear attack against their masters, devastating the planet and making it uninhabitable. The new Earth is found to be inhabited by early humans, who are genetically compatible with the humans from the Galactica and the rest of the fleet, but who possess only the most rudimentary civilization. Human beings had apparently evolved independently on both Earth and Kobol, the original home world of the humans who settled the Twelve Colonies.

The surviving humans and humanoid Cylons settle on the new planet; they discard all technology, destroying the fleet by flying it into the Sun, in order to postpone the creation of robotic servants until their society has progressed to higher ethics. The surviving Cylon Centurions are given possession of the remaining Cylon Basestar, and proceed to jump away from Earth. In the final scenes, modern-day Earth humans are shown to be descendants of the colonists, their humanoid Cylon allies, and the early humans.

At the end of the series finale, an angelic Baltar and Cylon [[Number Six]] (played by Tricia Helfer) are walking down a sidewalk in modern-day [[New York City]]. They are unseen and unheard by the people around them. As the two walk, they notice technologically advanced robots, computers, and other cybernetic devices, and they talk about the technological advancements the humans have made since the Colonists and Humanoid Cylons first arrived to this Earth, over 150,000 years earlier. Cylon Number Six and Baltar have an exchange over one of the on-going themes from the series, &quot;All of this has happened before. But the question remains, does all of this have to happen again?

Blood and Chrome ia a 2010 continuation series of the remake Battlestar Galactica (2004 Series). It is currently in-production and is set to air online before debuting on TV on Friday, November 9, 2012. It was announced/leaked in mid-2010 by Michael Taylor (Battlestar Galactica producer and writer).

Blood &amp; Chrome, starring Luke Pasqualino (The Borgias) and Ben Cotton (Alcatraz), will premiere on the young male-skewing Machinima's [http://www.youtube.com/user/machinima?feature=watch| channel], Machinima Prime, beginning Friday. The film will be broken up into 10, seven- to 12-minute episodes online until February and will remain on Machinima until April.

==Plot/Storyline==
The film takes place, as a prequel, in the midst of the first [[Cylon]] war. As the battle between humans and their creation, the sentient robotic Cylons, rages across the 12 colonial world, gifted fighter pilot [[William Adama]] (Pasqualino), finds himself assigned to one of the most powerful [[Battlestar|battlestars]] in the [[Colonial Fleet]]: the Galactica. Full of ambition and hungry for action, Adama quickly finds himself at odds with his co-pilot, the battle-weary officer Coker (Cotton). With only 47 days left in his tour of duty, Coker desires an end to battle as much as Adama craves its onset.

[[Image:FTL Jump -- Battlestar Galactica (2004).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Battlestar (re-imagining)|Battlestar]] ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]]'' performs an FTL jump]]
An '''FTL''', or &quot;Faster Than Light&quot;, drive is a [[fiction]]al propulsion technology from the re-imagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' [[television program|television series]]. It allows [[spacecraft]] to achieve [[faster-than-light]] travel.

The verb ''jump'' is commonly used to describe the process of travelling via FTL drive. Dialogue states that the drive itself is &quot;spooled up&quot; prior to use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mini Series, Part 1&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)| title=Mini Series, Part 1| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|Battlestar Galactica: The Miniseries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scar&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Scar (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Scar| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term FTL is commonly used in the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' film and television series. The term FTL is also commonly used when the show is being discussed by outside parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/about/glossary/|title=Battlestar Galactica Glossary|accessdate=2007-04-22|author=scifi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physics ==
According to producer interviews in the first-season DVD, the [[special effect]]s director indicated that the FTL is a dimensional transport effect, where the ships instantaneously [[teleportation|teleport]] from one place to another. Although other methods of FTL were considered for production, producers [[David Eick]] and [[Ronald D. Moore]] chose the dimensional jump effect over more complex ideas to keep things simple, under budget, and focused on the story.

During the events of &quot;[[Islanded in a Stream of Stars]]&quot;, [[Sharon Valerii#Sharon .22Boomer.22 Valerii|Boomer]], who has abducted [[Hera Agathon|Hera]] and is on her way to the [http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Cylon_homeworld Cylon Colony] states that it will take as many as a dozen FTL jumps to reach her destination from their current position.

FTL drives are fuelled by a refined version of the fictional ore [[tylium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Hand of God&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Hand of God (Battlestar Galactica)| title=The Hand of God| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jump drives distort space in an area near where they are activated. Jumping while too close to another vessel can damage it.

== Navigation ==
Owing to difficulties navigating while using an FTL drive, ships wishing to make an FTL jump must calculate their speed, trajectory and jump duration prior to activating their FTL drive. Failure to do so can lead to ships jumping into poorly charted areas where sub-light navigation is difficult, or into dangerous areas such as those containing asteroid fields, gravity wells, or even inside a planet's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lay Down Your Burdens&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Lay Down Your Burdens| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ship making a properly calculated jump can arrive safely in [[planetary orbit]], or alongside other ships or spaceborne objects. Ships using the same calculations can also safely jump together. Non-calculated jumps (known as a &quot;blind jump&quot;) are possible, as is risked by [[Helena Cain|Admiral Cain]] aboard ''Pegasus'' during the Cylon sneak attack of the Scorpian Shipyards in the season two episode &quot;[[Pegasus (Battlestar Galactica)|Pegasus]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pegasus&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Pegasus (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Pegasus| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jump co-ordinates must be constantly updated to allow for changes in a ship's position, and for [[stellar drift]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scattered&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Scattered (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Scattered| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
The safe limit of FTL travel for the [[Twelve Colonies]] is known as the &quot;[[List of Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining) locations#Red Line|Red Line]]&quot;. A ship jumping beyond this line risks running into unknown navigational hazards, or going off course due to compound errors in its jump calculation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mini Series, Part 2&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)| title=Mini Series, Part 2| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|Battlestar Galactica: The Miniseries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of Season 4, Galactica begins showing signs of metal fatigue and other problems associated with irreparable battle damage and age. Chief Tyrol advises Admiral Adama to avoid stressing the ship with additional FTL jumps.&lt;ref name=&quot;No Exit&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=No Exit| title=No Exit| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cylon technology ==
Cylon ships are capable of more accurate jumps than Colonial ships&lt;ref name=&quot;Lay Down Your Burdens&quot;/&gt;, and they can also make longer jumps than Colonial craft of a similar size.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kobol's Last Gleaming&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Kobol's Last Gleaming| title=Kobol's Last Gleaming| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[Lay Down Your Burdens]]&quot;, a Cylon Heavy Raider needs only ten jumps to Caprica, in comparison to the ''Galactica'' which needs over 200.

Cylons also use [[tylium]] ore as their fuel source.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Hand of God&quot; /&gt;

When the Rebel Cylons make a deal with ''Galactica''{{'}}s fleet, they offer to upgrade the Fleet's FTL drives so they can go as far and as fast as Cylon ships. Galen Tyrol says the upgrades are so complex they have to be done by Cylons. He also says the upgrade to Cylon drives would increase the efficiency of the jump drives by three times and triple the Fleet's jump distance.

'''DRADIS''' (made up from the terms Direction, RAnge, and DIStance), is a fictional tracking technology used in the re-imagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' miniseries and television show, as well as related spinoff media.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Gamers Staff, &quot;[http://www.criticalgamers.com/archives/rpgs/battlestar_galactica_rpg_looms.php Battlestar Galactica RPG Appears on DRADIS],&quot; ''Critical Gamers'' (September 21, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in series==
The system is used for detecting and scanning vessels and other objects in a 4-dimensional space. Although the terms &quot;range&quot; and &quot;distance&quot; are synonymous in meaning, they indicate different factors of 3-dimensional tracking. One term is used to describe a target's horizontal position along the planar X and Y coordinates relative to the centerline of tracking vessel. The other represents the target's vertical position, or elevation, relative to the tracking ship centerline.

Although the DRADIS appears multi-functional with the ability to scan for water&lt;ref name=&quot;Water&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Water (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Water| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and radiation signatures,&lt;ref name=&quot;ThirtyThree&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=33 (Battlestar Galactica)| title=33| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the technology is generally used within the show as the primary means of detecting other vessels and spatial bodies, for example a [[Cylon Basestar (re-imagining)|Cylon Basestar]] or the planet [[Kobol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Act of Contrition&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Act of Contrition (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Act of Contrition| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The season two episode &quot;[[Flight of the Phoenix (Battlestar Galactica)|Flight of the Phoenix]]&quot; reveals that [[carbon|carbon composites]] are not detected by DRADIS systems.

==Influence outside of series==
A number of computer computer programs are called &quot;DRADIS&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;long Zheng, &quot;[http://www.istartedsomething.com/20060802/dradis/ DRADIS: Awesome ISV Vista Application]&quot; (August 2nd, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/dradis dradis],&quot; ''SourceForge.net''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eastern Alliance''' is a militaristic and totalitarian [[human]] interstellar state in the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' television series, the Eastern Alliance is opposed by the Western Coalition. It is primarily located on the planet [[List of Battlestar Galactica (1978, 1980) locations#Terra|Terra]].

==Real world parallels==
Josef Steiff identifies the &quot;Eastern Alliance&quot; as a stand in &quot;for the '[[Eastern Bloc]]' countries of the Soviet Union,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Josef Steiff, ''Battlestar Galactica and Philosophy'' (2008), 242.&lt;/ref&gt; while John Kenneth Muir sees this &quot;enemy as ruthless as the Cylons&quot; as &quot;[[fascist]]ic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Muir, ''An analytical guide to television's Battlestar Galactica'' (1999), 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
John Kenneth Muir writes that &quot;The Eastern Alliance forces would reappear in the next episode, 'Baltar's Escape,' as well as in 'Experiment in Terra'...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Muir, ''An analytical guide to television's Battlestar Galactica'' (1999), 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
=== Government ===
The Alliance is a totalitarian and seemingly fascist state which maneuvered the Western President into a questionable peace treaty. During &quot;Greetings from Earth&quot; it is learned that the Alliance uses nuclear weapons to &quot;clear&quot; habitable planets of Western populations and that they time the strikes for maximum casualties (as done on Paradyne). It is further revealed that the Alliance has been wiping out every Western satellite one at a time while the President did nothing to stop them in &quot;Experiment in Terra&quot;. Later in the episode, the Alliance actually launches all the nuclear weapons they have in a surprise strike to wipe out the West and end the war. They deliberately attack during the Western President’s speech to the Presidium about the (worthless) peace treaty, and moved the “critical and loyal” part of their population into deep underground bomb shelters. The Commandant refuses to warn the general population of the Alliance, saying that losses will be acceptable and that overpopulation is one of their biggest problems.

=== Ships ===
The standard Alliance ship is the Star Destroyer. All Destroyers are numbered (i.e. &quot;Destroyer Two&quot;) and patrol set areas in and around Terra and the various satellites such as Paradyne or Lunar Seven. 
The Destroyer is small enough to land in the Galactica's landing bay and is crewed by about six men besides the officer. 
While questioning the officer, Adama states that the Alliance &quot;would need a thousand such destroyers to attack the Galactica&quot; and the officer replies with &quot;we have nearly...&quot; but realizes what he is saying and stops talking.

=== Small Arms ===
The Alliance favors a large laser rifle with a red pulsing strobe light. It is unknown if it has multiple settings or what its range might be. While Western weapons aren't directly seen in the series, in &quot;Experiment in Terra&quot; Western troops are seen after Starbuck lands and they do not carry such a rifle. 

=== Technology ===
Both sides seemingly have a level of technology which is between that of modern Earth and the Colonies. They are more advanced than Earth in that they have deep space faring ships, force fields, laser guns and cryogenics. However, unlike the Colonials they still utilize wheeled vehicles, lack ships capable of light speed and cannot defend themselves against nuclear warfare.

==Analysis and reception==
Josef Steiff argues that the show &quot;suggests that Evil is ''universal'' (existing in...the Eastern Alliance, per 'Experiment in Terra') and that its agenda is to lead humanity astray, away from the light and the universe of the spirit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Josef Steiff, ''Battlestar Galactica and Philosophy'' (2008), 332.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, John Kenneth Muir writes that Eastern Alliance forces have &quot;little impact&quot; and that &quot;in execution, the Eastern Alliance baddies were not really much more interesting than the faceless [[Cylons]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Muir, ''An analytical guide to television's Battlestar Galactica'' (1999), 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9020">{{Wikipedia}}
This is a list of terms used in the [[Battlestar Galactica]] [[television series]].

==Dialect==
* '''2-alpha''' - Voluntary Mission.
* ''' back to the barn''' - Back to base. 
* '''boxing''' or '''to be boxed''' - originally a Cylon term. To download a Cylon's consciousness into a storage device instead of a new body. This can happen either as a punishment or for safety reasons, when said consciousness is deemed corrupted or too unstable to be downloaded into a new body. 
* '''Code Blue!''' - internal security alarm call.
* '''felgercarb''' - profanity. In the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' series, used contextually as if it meant &quot;[[shit]]&quot;. Near the end of the new series, Felgercarb turns up only once, as the brand name of the last surviving tube of Colonial toothpaste.
* '''frack''' - profanity. Same meaning as &quot;f word&quot;, used in the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978)]]'' series. See '''frak'''.
* '''frak''' - new spelling for &quot;frack&quot; used in the new ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. (Same meaning as &quot;[[fuck]]&quot;). Same usage as the original series, but greatly expanded, and it also seems to carry the same &quot;social weight&quot; as fuck, as characters sometimes apologise for their language after using it. 
** '''frak-head''' - from the new ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' miniseries, derived from &quot;frak&quot;, substitution for &quot;[[asshole]]&quot; or &quot;fuck-head&quot;: when the miniseries originally aired on SciFi channel the phrase &quot;superior asshole&quot; was used by Starbuck (Kara Thrace) - when later aired on NBC the phrase became &quot;superior frak-head&quot;.
** '''frakwit/frakwad''' - Used once by [[Galen Tyrol|Chief Tyrol]] when explaining to the Pegasus deck chief why the Galactica deck crew was so angry. He said that [[Helena Cain|Admiral Cain]] had assigned &quot;some frakwad from the Pegasus&quot; to be Galactica's new deck chief. As it turns out, the person who he was explaining it to was that frakwad, but he did not seem in any way offended.
** '''motherfrakker''' - derived from &quot;frak&quot; in parallel to &quot;motherfucker&quot;. Used first by [[Specialist Cally]] in Season 2 and later by Lieutenant Kat and Starbuck, but apparently not standard usage, as [[Galen Tyrol|Chief Tyrol]] finds Cally's usage quite amusing, though this may also be because Cally rarely (if ever) curses.
** '''toasterfrakker''' - by extension, someone, like [[Karl Agathon|Helo]], who's had sexual congress with a human-model Cylon.
* '''galmonging''' - derogatory term only used in the original series. Roughly the same meaning as &quot;bastard&quot; or &quot;asshole&quot;. First used in Part 1 of &quot;[[The Living Legend|Living Legend]]&quot;.
* '''Krypter!''' - distress call equivalent to &quot;[[Mayday (distress signal)|MayDay]]&quot;. Usually repeated in quick succession: &quot;Krypter! Krypter! Krypter!&quot;. First heard used by [[Lee Adama]] in the miniseries.
* '''Oh my Gods!''', - derived from real life phrase &quot;Oh My God&quot;, plural usage due to the [[Lords of Kobol|main faith of the Twelve Colonies]].
* '''morpho''' - pain killer similar to morphine, given to Starbuck on the algae planet by Dualla. The etymology of morphine itself comes from [[Morpheus]], the Greek god of dreams.
* '''projecting''' - Cylon term. To create a virtual reality in someone's own mind. Cylon human-models use projecting as a break from reality, a rough equivalent to daydreaming. Another application of projecting is to make traveling around [[Cylon Basestar|basestar]]s easier for human-model Cylons. Because all the corridors and hallways in a Basestar look very similar, Cylons &quot;project&quot; familiar surroundings in order to find their way more easily. For example, Number Six sees the inside of a basestar as a large forest. When [[Gaius Baltar|Baltar]] first hears of projecting in the season three [[Torn (Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]] episode, he realises that projecting is strikingly similar to the hallucinations involving [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]] he's experiencing, thus reinforcing his suspicions that he might be a Cylon himself.
* '''wireless''' - essentially an alternate term for a [[radio]] or a device that transfers and receives radio wave band transmissions. In real life this usage was encountered during (and in some places after) World War II in [[England]].
* '''sitrep''' - 'situation report'
* '''Sierra Alpha''' - suspicious activity (derived from [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] codewords for [[S]] and [[A]])
* '''stims''' - similar to speed. stimulant pills pilots may take to stay awake. 
* '''tylium''' - mineral that can be refined to a powerful fuel
* '''ambrosia''' - a type of alcoholic beverage
* '''carom''' - term used in conjunction with a DRADIS contact read; analogous to the term &quot;mark&quot;.
* '''wilco''' - 'will comply'

==Slang and nicknames==
*'''Beast, the''' - nickname of battlestar [[Battlestar Pegasus|Pegasus]], given by the crew of [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]]. See '''Bucket'''.
*'''Big G, the''' - nickname given by the crew to the [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]].
*'''bird farm''' - a battlestar, in colonial military jargon.  Borrowed from contemporary American slang for [[aircraft carriers]].
*'''blackshirt''' - profane term for Council Security. Only used in the original series.
*'''Bucket, the''' - nickname of battlestar [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]], given by the crew of [[Battlestar Pegasus|Pegasus]]. See '''Beast'''.
*'''chrome job''' - pejorative term used by Humans to describe Cylon centurions. Also used in this context is the pejorative term '''bullethead'''. See '''skin job'''.
*'''Download City''' - slang term used by Humans to describe a place where Cylons are resurrected. Usually refers to a [[Resurrection ship]]. First used in the season 3 episode &quot;[[Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)|Exodus]]&quot;.
*'''jock smock''' - flight suit.
*'''knuckle-dragger''' - slang term for [[enlisted rank|enlisted]] personnel. Roughly equivalent to the Earth military slang &quot;grunt&quot;, it can be taken as a somewhat snobbish pejorative when used by an officer, but many [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s use the term with a touch of pride (particularly [[Galen Tyrol]]).  Also used by personnel within the U.S. Navy to refer to an enlisted person that has the engineering rating Machinist's Mate.
*'''nugget''' - nickname given to trainee pilots.
*'''rain''' - The sound of the metal scrap hitting fighter in space after combat.
*'''skin job''' - pejorative term used by Humans to describe human-model Cylons. Originally a [[Blade Runner]] term, it was first used in Season 2. See '''chrome job'''.
*'''toaster''' - pejorative term used by Humans to describe Cylon centurions.

==Acronyms==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21364">[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]]
Some of the elements of the two ''Battlestar Galactica'' science-fiction television series seem to be derived from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon Mormon] beliefs of their creator, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_A._Larson Glen A. Larson]. For example, in both series the planet [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobol Kobol] is the ancient and distant homeworld of the human race. According to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jana_Riess Jana Riess], author of ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Would_Buffy_Do%3F What Would Buffy Do?]'', Kobol as an anagram of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolob Kolob] is only one of many plot points borrowed from Mormonism by Larson.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-0&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_mythological_references_in_Battlestar_Galactica#cite_note-0 [1]]&lt;/sup&gt; In [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism Mormonism], Kolob is the star or planet nearest to the throne of God.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-1&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_mythological_references_in_Battlestar_Galactica#cite_note-1 [2]]&lt;/sup&gt; It has also been suggested that the basic plot is a retelling of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil Virgil]'s [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid Aeneid], a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome Roman] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poem epic poem] describing how [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneas Aeneas], after the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War Fall of Troy], leads the survivors on a journey and eventually founds Rome.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-2&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_mythological_references_in_Battlestar_Galactica#cite_note-2 [3]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-3&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_mythological_references_in_Battlestar_Galactica#cite_note-3 [4]]&lt;/sup&gt;

The &quot;Lords of Kobol&quot; are sacred figures in both series. They are treated as elders or patriarchs in the original series, while in the new series they are versions of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Olympians Twelve Olympians]. In both series, Humankind is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheistic polytheistic], believing in multiple gods similar to those in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology Greek mythology]. Humans are the descendants of the gods called the Lords of Kobol. The twelve colonies are named after the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_sign astrological signs] of the Greek [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac zodiac]; for example, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Colonies Scorpia] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpio_%28astrology%29 Scorpio]), [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprica_%28planet%29 Caprica] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_%28astrology%29 Capricorn]), and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Battlestar_Galactica_%28reimagining%29_locations#Aquaria Aquaria] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_%28astrology%29 Aquarius]). Several of the characters in the series have names or call signs corresponding to significant characters in Greek mythology, including [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo Apollo], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena Athena], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_%28mythology%29 Cassiopeia].

The Quorum of Twelve is analogous to the similarly named Quorum in Mormonism.

In the original series, referring to marriage as &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealing_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29 sealing]&quot; is another Mormon element used in the original series. There is also a common book of worship known as &quot;The Book of the Word&quot;. In Season 1 Ep. 7 &quot;The Long Patrol&quot; Starbuck is imprisoned in a jail consisting of inmates born and raised within it held accountable for and named for the crimes of their ancestors. These ancestors are referred to as &quot;Original Sinners&quot; deriving their family names from this &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin original sin]&quot; as with the Christian theological concept. While on Kobol, Adama speaks in a monologue about the various cities, and mentions that &quot;Eden was the first to fall&quot;.

The Cylons have no religion.
===Humans===
In the re-imagined series, during the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora diaspora] from the 12 colonies, and subsequent search for the mythical planet Earth (the thirteenth colony), the human survivors find out that the holy scriptures are true and that Kobol is a cursed planet where, due to the humans leaving blood will be shed, due in part to the practice of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice human sacrifice] by the gods for the humans. Time is perceived in classical Indian and Greek fashion of cycles (in contrast to the Jewish and Christian concepts of linear time); the major running theme is ''All of this has happened before and all of this will happen again''&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-4&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_mythological_references_in_Battlestar_Galactica#cite_note-4 [5]]&lt;/sup&gt; or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_recurrence Eternal recurrence]. The presence of religious figures known as oracles, distinct in role from priests, calls up the image of ancient Greek oracles, such as the famous oracle of Pythia. In the reimagined series, a part of the Sacred Scrolls is named the Book of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia Pythia],&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-5&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_mythological_references_in_Battlestar_Galactica#cite_note-5 [6]]&lt;/sup&gt; named after the priestess presiding over the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle Oracle] of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo Apollo] at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi Delphi]. Overall, the religion of the humans resembles most closely that of Greek [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism Stoicism].

There is a parallel between the Twelve Colonies (named after the signs of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac Zodiac]) and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Tribes_of_Israel Twelve Tribes of Israel] in the search for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promised_land promised land]. The diaspora is as much a trial of faith for President [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Roslin Laura Roslin] as was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses Moses]'s 40-year journey for him while it is a mere four year journey for Roslin. Roslin finds herself a reluctant prophetic figure whose visions help uncover the path to Earth and who will subsequently die as a result of her part in the diaspora, much like Moses.

The Wikipedia article on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac Zodiac] has this to say about the Twelve Tribes of Israel:
&quot;The Babylonian zodiac also finds reflection in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible Hebrew Bible]. The name of the twelve signs are equivalent to the names in use today, except that the name of the Eagle seems to have been usually substituted for Scorpio. The arrangement of the twelve tribes of Israel around the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabernacle Tabernacle] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Numbers Book of Numbers], Chapter 2) corresponded to the order of the Zodiac; and four of the tribes represented the middle signs of each quarter: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_%28Biblical_person%29 Judah] was the Lion, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_%28Bible%29 Reuben] the Man, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephraim Ephraim] the Bull, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_%28Bible%29 Dan] the Eagle. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mann Thomas Mann] in ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_and_His_Brothers Joseph and His Brothers]'' takes the Blessing of Jacob as attributing characteristics of a sign of the zodiac to each tribe. The faces of the cherubim, in both [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Ezekiel Ezekiel] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation Revelation], are the middle signs of the four quarters of the Zodiac: the Lion is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_%28astrology%29 Leo]; the Bull is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_%28astrology%29 Taurus]; the Man is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_%28astrology%29 Aquarius]; and the Eagle is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpio_%28astrology%29 Scorpio].&quot;
These signs of the four quarters of the zodiac are also used in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_symbolism Christian symbolism] to represent the four authors of the Christian [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel#Canonical_gospels Gospels].

The opening theme song for seasons two, three, and four (1-4 in the UK) includes a famous Hindu mantra, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayatri_Mantra Gayatri Mantra], taken from the Rig Veda. The words are
OM&lt;br /&gt;bhûr bhuvah svah&lt;br /&gt;tat savitur varenyam&lt;br /&gt;bhargô devasya dhîmahi&lt;br /&gt;dhiyô yô nah pracôdayât
which may be translated in various ways but may mean:
Earth, air, heaven&lt;br /&gt;We meditate upon the excellence&lt;br /&gt;Of the radiant Sun&lt;br /&gt;May it bring light to our paths.&quot;&lt;sup class=&quot;Template-Fact&quot; style=&quot;white-space: nowrap;&quot;&gt;[''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed citation needed]'']&lt;/sup&gt;
Another translation is:

===Cylon===
In the re-imagined series, the Cylons are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotheistic monotheistic] in believing in one god, resembling a caricature of the Neo-Platonic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_%28philosophy%29 One]. However, this god is not the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creator_deity creator]. The Cylons look upon themselves as the children of mankind and see their human creators as intrinsically flawed and want to destroy them; thus the genocide at the beginning of the 2003 miniseries. This resembles the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnostic Gnostic] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualistic dualistic] belief that material creation and its creator (the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge Demiurge]) are evil and that true [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation salvation] comes from knowledge (Greek: gnosis) of a timeless God beyond creation. According to Gnostic Christian belief, the true God is manifest on earth through Christ. Gnostics hold that their views are consistent with their own reading of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon canonical] scriptures; however true knowledge of God can only be perceived by a chosen few through special insight or secret instruction outside of canonical scripture.

Also the Gnostic idea that the true God is irremediably concealed from much of humanity resembles the Cylon view of the worthlessness of humanity as well as the low worth of the metallic centurion Cylon models whom most of the android Cylons treat as second-class citizens. (Indeed, this is one of the issues that causes a rift, late in the series, among the android Cylons, some of whom believe that the centurions should be recognized as equals.) Some Cylons (Six, for example) also seem to think that some humans (Gaius Baltar, primarily) can be saved; although the analogy breaks down at this point because Six expects Gaius to accept the one true God on the basis of faith rather than through special knowledge.

In some ways the Cylons share a few similarities with pre-diaspora Judaism. (Not to mention that the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylon_Basestar Cylon Basestar] resembles the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David Star of David], when seen from above.) Models number one, four and five differ ideologically from models two, three, six and eight. In the episode [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ties_That_Bind_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29 The Ties That Bind], Cavil (an incarnation of model number one) states that &quot;there is no afterlife&quot; - a view held by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees Sadducees]. Finally, models one, four, and five follow their precepts literally in the same way that the Sadducees took the scriptures literally. The rival Cylon faction (made up of model numbers two, three, six and eight share a different set of views. These Cylons believed that people have free will but that God also has foreknowledge of human destiny, a view of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees Pharisaical Judaism]. The Cylons also took seriously the words of their [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylon_Basestar#The_Hybrid hybrid], whom they saw as a prophet and looked to the child of Sharon &amp; Karl Agathon as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Messiah Messianic figure] in the same ways that the Pharisees heeded the words of their Prophets and looked for the coming of a Messiah. The Sadducees, however, only followed the strict writings of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah Torah] and paid little heed to the Prophets.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-7&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_mythological_references_in_Battlestar_Galactica#cite_note-7 [8]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Another parallel with antiquity is that the Cylon hybrids and their utterances bear many resemblances to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibyl#The_later_Sibyls Twelve Sibyls of the Ancient World] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibylline_oracles Sibylline oracles]. Mediæval Christians believed that these oracles prophesied the coming of the Messiah and Christianity.
===Life and Death===
In the re-imagined series, the Cylons don't have a childhood or die - they [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnate reincarnate] with their mind born into a new adult body, joining the collective culture where there is no room for individuality. But the few Cylons who have experienced deep love or great pain develop feelings and stand out from the collective and become more integrated with their corporeal bodies. A copy of a Number 6, named Gina, was tortured and abused on the Battlestar ''Pegasus'' in the second season. She tried to escape reincarnation by ending her life permanently, similar to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu Hindu] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist Buddhist] belief of ending the cycle of the material birth and rebirth.
===Names===
In the re-imagined series, the last name of '''Kara Thrace''', refers to a region that includes part of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece Greece], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria Bulgaria] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Thrace European Turkey]&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-8&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_mythological_references_in_Battlestar_Galactica#cite_note-8 [9]]&lt;/sup&gt; . In Greek mythology this region provided a number of Greek kings (including [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycurgus_%28Thrace%29 Lycurgus], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas Phineas] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus Orpheus]'s father) and was known for its mercenaries. Colonial Warriors (Galactica's Viper pilots) wear a patch on the right shoulder of their flight jackets somewhat similar to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Chakra Sri Chakra], a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yantra yantra]. Her nickname, '''Starbuck''', is a character of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick Moby-Dick] (see Sharon Valerii).

'''Saul Tigh''' (originally called Paul prior to production, but changed due to legal issues&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-9&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_mythological_references_in_Battlestar_Galactica#cite_note-9 [10]]&lt;/sup&gt;) persecuted the Cylons, then, after he lost an eye, later discovered that he was himself a Cylon. Similarly, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_of_Tarsus Saul of Tarsus] (later called Paul), persecuted the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians Christians]. Then, when [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ Jesus Christ] appeared to him on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_to_Damascus road to Damascus] he became temporarily blinded, and decided to become a follower of Christ.

'''Dr. Gaius Baltar''' ('''''Count Baltar''''' in the original series) shares his first name with of one of the disciples of Paul of Tarsus, mentioned in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_the_Apostles Acts of the Apostles]. The Book of Acts also mentions an &quot;Apollo&quot; (the callsign for '''Lee Adama''') as another disciple of Paul. Gaius was also the praenomen of Gaius Julius Caesar. In Episode '''Daybreak part 1''' his father is named Julius.

'''Sharon Valerii''' (an incarnation of Cylon model Number Eight) shares her last name with an ancient Roman Family, the Valerii (plural of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerius Valerius]), many of whose members are buried under [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Basilica St. Peter's Basilica]. Her nickname, '''Boomer''', is a character of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick Moby-Dick] (see Kara Thrace).

'''Karl &amp; Sharon Agathon''' share their last name with a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agathon tragic poet from ancient Greece]. Furthermore, in Ancient Greek ἀγαθός (agathos) means someone who is good, virtuous and honest.

'''Laura Roslin''' shares her last name with a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roslin,_Midlothian village in Scotland] where there is a chapel reputed to be the secret location of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail Holy Grail].

'''Galen Tyrol''' shares his first name with the prominent Roman physician and philosopher of Greek origin, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen Galen] of Pergamum, whose theories dominated western medical science for more than a millennium.

'''Anastasia Dualla''' shares her first name with an early Christian martyr, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_of_Sirmium St. Anastasia].

The word ''helo'' (Karl Agathon's callsign) is the Greek word for ''thorn''.

The Commanding Officer of Battlestar ''Galactica'', '''William Adama''', gets his last name from Adam, the first man created in the Bible. &quot;Adama&quot; is also the Hebrew word for Earth, as well as Diamond, Ground, Dirt, or Indestructible (Adamant, Diamant, Diamond).

The original pitch for the show (in the late 1960s) was called &quot;Adam's Ark&quot;, which was subsequently renamed &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. Larson's first concept was to retell various biblical stories in a futuristic, space-faring setting.&lt;sup class=&quot;reference&quot; id=&quot;cite_ref-10&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_mythological_references_in_Battlestar_Galactica#cite_note-10 [11]]&lt;/sup&gt;
===Religious Terms and Expressions===
&quot;'''So say we all'''&quot; has been used as the ending of a communal prayer in the re-imagined series, much as ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen Amen]'' is used at the end of prayers in many faiths. ''Amen'' has been used in the show as well, though on rare occasion.

In the episode [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobol%27s_Last_Gleaming Kobol's Last Gleaming] the humans stranded on Kobol recite a prayer containing the phrase &quot;'''vale of tears'''&quot;, which is a line taken from one of the Catholic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_antiphons Marian antiphons], the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salve_Regina Salve Regina]. The phrase is often rendered in modern English as &quot;''valley'' of tears&quot;.

In the episode [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Measure_of_Salvation A Measure of Salvation], Lee Adama mentions that the Cylons were saying a prayer to the '''Cloud of Unknowing'''--a reference to a popular [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cloud_of_Unknowing Medieval English religious book].

When Kara Thrace first interrogates Leoben on Galactica, Leoben's quote is, &quot;What is the most basic Article of Faith?&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Faith Articles of Faith] are statements of belief by various religions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3605">The Astral Queen is a prison barge holding 1,500 prisoners including Tom Zarek who is a well known anti government activist and an eco-terrorist. The ship is [[File:200px-Bsg-astral-1.jpg|thumb|The Astral Queen.]][[FTL]] capable and has been put through a lot and survived it all. When the [[Galactica]] lost its water supply, captain Lee Adama and a few others went to the ship to persuade the prisoners to transport water from an ice moon. Tom Zarek tels the group that the prisoners respectfully decline their offer which breaks out into a riot which is quickly stifles. A little later the prisoners break out and storm the Queen's command deck, taking everyone hostage and putting them in cells. Zarek takes control of the ship demanding the resignation of the president [[Laura Roslin]] and demanding free and open elections to elect a new president. Adama and Roslin refuse but Lee Adama already made the deal and evacuated all personel and gave full control of the Astral Queen to [[Tom Zarek]] and his men on the terms that they don't use the ship on a suicide run and in return they will rely on the fleet for food, water, and fuel.

Astral Queen

The Astral Queen is a prisoner transport ship. There are currently 1,500 prisoners on board (a figure retconned from 500). The Astral Queen was transporting prisoners from [[Sagittaron]] to their parole hearings on Caprica at the time of Cylon attack and is one of the vessels that manage to regroup with President Roslin's refugee fleet. Viewed as another transport ship, albeit one with a slightly undesirable cargo, none of the government personnel that survived the assault knew that it was carrying Tom Zarek, a dangerous political prisoner and anti-government terrorist.

Following an attack on the fleet water supply, Captain Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama is dispatched to the ship in order to enlist the prisoners so they can help transport water from an icy moon that has been found nearby. After greeting the prisoners' spokesman, Tom Zarek, the prisoners break out of their cells and manage to hijack the ship. They later surrender once Apollo agrees to Zarek's demands, which are to hold a fair election for a new president at the end of Roslin's term. In return, Apollo leaves Zarek's men in control of the Astral Queen, against the wishes of both President Roslin and Commander Adama.

The Astral Queen becomes the focus of several incidents within the fleet. First, repair crews made up of the vessel's ex-convicts begin to operate in competition with those organized by the government. For these efforts, Tom Zarek becomes the Sagittaron representative to the reformed [[Quorum of Twelve]]. From there, Zarek makes a failed bid at the vice presidency.

Later, after Laura Roslin is stripped of her presidency by Commander Adama, and martial law is declared in the fleet, the Astral Queen becomes the flagship of a splinter group departing the fleet for Kobol, made up of 24 ships. The crews and passengers of these ships are supporters of Laura Roslin's presidency, and she is aboard the Astral Queen when it jumps away from the fleet. The splinter fleet rejoins Galactica and the fleet after Commander Adama and President Roslin resolve their differences.

The same ship design appears in the original series, where it is known simply as the &quot;[[Prison Barge]]&quot;, but serves the same basic function as it does in the re-imagining. Count Baltar spends most of the latter part of the series imprisoned on the Prison Barge.

That ship was in turn named for the ship which serves as the centrepiece of Isaac Asimov's short story, Marooned off Vesta</text>

Tylium

Tylium is a metallic ore, and is very rare throughout the known universe, but essential for fueling both human and Cylon space ships, including for the purpose of FTL jumps. Tylium is the focus of episode 10, season one, and is pronounced &quot;till-ium&quot;, or occasionally &quot;Tylinium&quot;.

In the re-imagined series, raw Tylium ore appears as a yellow, sand-like substance before it is refined into a golden liquid similar in appearance to motor oil; however it flows quickly like gasoline. In the episode &quot;[[Dirty Hands]]&quot;, it is shown that the raw Tylium is stored in massive silos aboard the fleet's [[Refinery Ship]] where it is poured (by hand) onto conveyor belts and heated in ovens. It was never specified how this process actually converts the raw Tylium to a liquid state, however it is stated that &quot;hot&quot; Tylium is highly unstable, and if the carefully controlled process is interrupted it could &quot;go critical&quot; and explode.

In the episode &quot;[[The Hand of God]]&quot;, Gaius Baltar mentions in dialog that the enthalpy of refined Tylium is (the enthalpy of combustion of gasoline is by comparison). Tylium is unstable and has a strong exothermic reaction if sufficiently heated, especially the less stable refined Tylium precursor. It is also mentioned that Tylium will become useless if subjected to strong radiation, which renders the ore inert</text>

''' ''Prometheus''  (2004)'''

Prometheus is a cargo vessel that appeared in the episode &quot;[[Black Market]]&quot;. The ship has an &quot;open port&quot; policy similar to [[Cloud 9]] and became the headquarters for the fleet's black market operations. The black market was allowed, unofficially, to continue operations with the stipulations that there are no killings, that they don't hold back on essential medicines and their child prostitution ring is ended. The ship's name comes from Greek mythology, Prometheus the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans.

'''Osiris''' was an [[Orion-class]] warship in the Colonial Fleet during the [[First Cylon War]]. It was part of a secret Colonial fleet hidden deep within Cylon territory. &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The fleet consisted of colonial ships which were reportedly destroyed in various engagements during the first ten years of the First Cylon War. Individual crew members of the secret fleet were required to witness their own death certificates; even their families were unaware they were still alive. The actual destruction of the ship occurred over the ice planet Djerba, a former colonial winter resort destination. The Osiris was participating in a classified mission believed to be key in bringing about the end of the war. &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Outnumbered 10 to 1, the Osiris was unable to trigger its nuclear weapons due to damage sustained to its outer launch doors during the opening salvo with the basestar. &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The Commander of the Osiris ordered the ship crash into the [http://galactica.wikia.com/wiki/Basestar?action=edit&amp;redlink=1 Basestar], upon impact the commander manually triggered the nuclear weapons destroying &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the Osiris and the Basestar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2513">In the episode, the human fleet encounters the Battlestar [[Pegasus]], commanded by Admiral [[Helena Cain]]. She assumes command of the fleet. [[Gaius Baltar]] discovers that Pegasus crew members have been raping and torturing a Cylon prisoner. Cain sentences Helo and Chief [[Galen Tyrol]] to death after they accidentally kill a Pegasus officer who was preparing to rape Sharon. In response, Commander William [[Adama]] orders Vipers to escort Marines to Pegasus. Cain orders her own Vipers to intercept as the episode ends.

&quot;Pegasus&quot; was nominated for the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. It received favorable critical review

A large unknown ship appears on Galactica's [[DRADIS]]. After a tense moment, the ship is identified as the [[Battlestar Pegasus]], a Colonial vessel previously believed destroyed in the Cylon attack on the Colonies. Cain boards Galactica with an armed escort and welcomes the crew &quot;back to the Colonial Fleet.&quot; Cain relates to Adama and President Laura Roslin how she ordered a risky maneuver to escape the initial Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies. Adama recognizes Cain as his superior, but Cain promises not to interfere with Galactica's internal affairs.

Cain declines to resupply the fleet's civilian ships and integrates the battlestars' crews, transferring Apollo and [[Starbuck]] to Pegasus over Commander Adama's objections. Cain's executive officer, Colonel Jack Fisk, tells Colonel [[Saul Tigh]] how Cain shot his predecessor for refusing an order. Fisk claims his story is a joke, but Tigh believes it is true and relates the story to Adama. Adama reiterates his willingness to follow Cain, to both Roslin and Tigh, and insists that Apollo and Starbuck obey their transfer orders.

Baltar visits Gina,[1] a Number Six copy held prisoner aboard Pegasus. He and Head Six are horrified to discover that the Pegasus crew has systematically tortured and raped Gina. Baltar attempts to establish a rapport with Gina by providing food and confessing to his involvement with another Six copy on Caprica.

Helo and Tyrol rescue Sharon from imminent rape by a Pegasus interrogator but accidentally kill the interrogator in the process. Cain denies Adama's request that Helo and Tyrol be given a jury court-martial and sentences them both to death for murder and treason. Adama demands that Cain return them to Galactica and orders Vipers to escort a Marine assault team to Pegasus. Cain refuses and sends the Pegasus Vipers to intercept Galactica's</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2055">In the episode, Admiral Helena Cain and Commander William Adama call a truce but plan to assassinate each other. The humans destroy a Cylon fleet that includes a resurrection ship. Cain and Adama both cancel their plots, but Gina[2] escapes from the Pegasus brig and kills Cain.

Part 1

Both Viper groups seek permission to fire, but neither Cain nor Adama grants it. The standoff is interrupted by Starbuck, who returns in the Blackbird with photos of the Cylon vessel. Cain and Adama call off their attacks and agree to meet on Colonial One as neutral ground. President Laura Roslin mediates an uneasy truce: the resolution of Helo and Tyrol's fate will be delayed until after the attack on the Cylon fleet. Later, Roslin warns Adama privately that Cain will strike against Adama again and urges him to assassinate Cain first. Adama demurs.

Impressed by what she calls Starbuck's &quot;guts and initiative&quot;, Cain promotes her to Captain and appoints her Pegasus [[CAG]]. Starbuck persuades Cain to reinstate Apollo's flight status. Cain also promises Starbuck she will lead the fleet back to Caprica, destroy the Cylons, and rescue the survivors.

Doctor Cottle says Sharon will be all right. Adama apologizes to Sharon and orders her returned to her cell.

In Gina's cell, Cain abuses the Cylon prisoner. Gina begs Gaius Baltar to kill her. She tells him that the Cylon vessel is a &quot;resurrection ship&quot;, where Cylons are downloaded into new bodies; if it is destroyed Gina can die permanently. Cain resolves to destroy the ship, believing mortality will deter the Cylon pursuit.

Colonel  Jack Fisk tells Colonel Saul Tigh that Pegasus encountered a small civilian fleet. Cain ordered it stripped for parts, conscripted some civilian personnel, executed the families of any who resisted, and abandoned the rest in space. Realizing that Roslin is right about Cain, Adama orders Starbuck to assassinate Cain once the attack on the Cylon fleet concludes. Likewise, Cain directs Fisk to take a detachment of Marines to Galactica to kill Adama after the attack</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1896">Part 2

Two Pegasus crewmen confront Helo and Tyrol in the Pegasus brig and beat them with soap bars wrapped in towels; Fisk discovers the blanket party and ends it. Cain warns Starbuck not to let her conscience dictate how she behaves at difficult moments. Apollo agrees to help Starbuck with the assassination but expresses discomfort to his father. Adama invites Sharon to his quarters and asks why the Cylons hate humans; she replies that the Cylons don't hate humans but think them unworthy of life because of their tendency toward murder. As the battle nears, Starbuck and Fisk wish each other &quot;good hunting&quot;.

The battle begins. Piloting the Blackbird, Apollo prevents the resurrection ship from escaping but is forced to eject after a damaged Colonial Raptor collides with the Blackbird. His spacesuit leaks oxygen, but a search and rescue Raptor locates him and revives him. The humans destroy the resurrection ship and the two Basestars guarding it. Cain and Adama contact Fisk and Starbuck respectively, but neither gives the order to assassinate. Relieved, Fisk and Starbuck stand down.

Baltar signals his rejection of Head Six in favor of Gina by repeating to Gina a coquettish speech Head Six gave earlier. Baltar distracts the Marine guard so that Gina can kill him and take his side arm. Gina asks Baltar to kill her, but he urges her to seek justice, not death, and promises to hide her. Cain returns to her quarters following the battle to find Gina lying in wait for her. Gina shoots Cain and disappears.

Fisk and Starbuck eulogize Cain at her funeral. Fisk becomes Commander of Pegasus. Apollo confesses to Starbuck that he wanted to die in space. Helo and Tyrol return to Galactica. Helo and Sharon are reunited as Tyrol looks on. Recognizing that Adama now commands two battlestars, Roslin promotes him to Admiral. Adama helps the ailing Roslin to her feet and kisses her.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2556">In the episode, Dee spurns [[Billy Keikeya ]]and goes on a date with Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama at a bar. An armed group takes control of the bar, demanding the captive Cylon Sharon in return for the lives of their hostages. Lee is badly wounded when Starbuck attempts a rescue. Billy is shot and killed saving Dee just before a team of Marines raids the bar and rescues the remaining hostages.

The episode focuses on Admiral William Adama's relationship with Sharon as he weighs the gunmen's demands. It also presents the gunmen's motives and raises questions about whether there is merit to their point of view.

In early drafts of the episode, Colonel Saul Tigh clashed with Adama over his handling of the crisis, but in the final version episode the two of them and President Laura Roslin all agree that they cannot bow to the demands of a group they call terrorists.

Plot

The press has learned that a Number Eight model Cylon is being held in Galactica's brig. Admiral Adama insists to President Laura Roslin that Sharon is a valuable source of intelligence. Billy, Roslin's chief of staff, urges Adama to tell the fleet about Sharon.

Billy proposes marriage to Dee, but Dee turns him down. Later he discovers Dee on a date with Lee in a bar on Cloud 9 and is heartbroken.

Gunmen led by Sesha Abinell take over the bar, demanding that the Admiral hand over Sharon. Learning that Abinell is seeking revenge for her husband's death in a Cylon attack, Adama refuses and orders Starbuck to plan a rescue with several Marines. A ruse by Lee convinces the gunmen that the bar is losing oxygen, giving Starbuck an opening. Her attempt backfires, and she accidentally shoots Lee during the confusion. Dee and Billy attend the bleeding, unconscious Lee. Roslin argues to Admiral Adama and Colonel Tigh they cannot give in to terrorists. As Abinell threatens Ellen Tigh, who is among the hostages, Adama agrees to hand over Sharon, but not alive.

Adama sends over the corpse of Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii, the Number Eight copy who shot him and died,[1] to give Marines time to storm the bar. Abinell shoots Boomer's corpse but discovers the deception shortly after. She orders Dee killed. Against Dee's advice, Billy grabs a gun and shoots the would-be executioner dead. As he dies, the executioner also shoots and kills Billy. The Marines kill the remaining gunmen, including Abinell, and free the hostages.

Roslin mourns Billy, whom she described as &quot;the closest thing I have to family left&quot;. Dee awaits Lee's recovery in Galactica's sickbay as Starbuck looks on</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2278">Plot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 1

Captain [[Starbuck]] is green-lit to lead a group of 20 Raptors back to [[Caprica]] to rescue the human resistance led by Samuel Anders. The team utilizes a captured Cylon navigation device wired into the Cylon prisoner Sharon Agathon, to increase the Raptor's jump range allowing them to get back to Caprica in only ten jumps. On the first jump however, they lose track of a Raptor piloted by Racetrack, whose mis-jump causes her to arrive inside a nebula. Debating with her ECO whether or not to try to catch up with the others, they stumble across a planet hidden in the nebula that, although somewhat harsh, can support human life.

Vice President Gaius Baltar finds himself behind in the polls with two weeks remaining until the presidential election. Once Racetrack returns with data on the new planet, Tom Zarek realizes that it provides a crucial election issue: an opportunity for permanent colonization. He convinces Baltar to push the idea in his campaign, believing that people cooped up in the fleet for nine months will support it overwhelmingly. President Laura Roslin suspects that the Cylons may already know of the hidden world and that their stay should only be long enough to gather fresh water and to grow food supplies.

In Galactica's hangar, Chief Galen Tyrol is found after sleepwalking, restlessly asleep on the deck by Specialist Cally. He snaps and violently assaults her after she wakes him. He later seeks religious counseling from a priest named Brother Cavil. Tyrol explains his dreams of jumping off a hangar bay catwalk to his death. Cavil believes it is Tyrol's subconscious desire to kill himself manifested from a fear that he too could be a Cylon &quot;sleeper agent&quot; like Boomer. When Tyrol asks how Brother Cavil can be so certain he is actually human, Cavil sarcastically reassures him that he is not a Cylon &quot;because I'm a Cylon and I've never seen you at any of the meetings&quot; and that Tyrol should return to his duties without worry.

On Caprica, Starbuck's rescue team arrives and locates the survivors including their leader Samuel Anders. Their resistance force has been reduced to no more than sixty. The survivors inform their rescuers that they are being pursued by Cylons and they come under immediate attack.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1937">Plot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part one

In the end of the previous episode &quot;Precipice&quot;, 200 humans are facing a Cylon Centurion firing squad. A few hours prior, [[Galen Tyrol]] (Aaron Douglas) receives the list from a source, and gathers a group of armed resistance members to the execution site and are able to destroy the Centurions before the execution takes place. Meanwhile, [[Sharon Agathon]] (Grace Park), Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco) and other resistance members are under fire from another group of Centurions, but are rescued by marines Sharon posted. Afterwards, Sharon discusses with the resistance her plan to rescue those on New Caprica from the Cylons; she is to go into the Cylon compound in the city to gather the launch keys for the ships on the ground while Galactica will distract the Cylons so the humans could escape. Anders finds the rendezvous map on one of the dead Cylons that [[Ellen Tigh]] (Kate Vernon) claimed to have burned. He confronts Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) about his wife's betrayal. Ellen confesses to her action, but claims to be doing it to keep Tigh alive.

Meanwhile, D'anna Biers (Lucy Lawless) has a nightmare and visits an oracle, who hints that Hera, the Cylon-Human baby who was born and supposedly killed in &quot;Downloaded&quot; is still alive, and D'anna &quot;will know true love&quot; again and hold the child in her arms. Later, Sharon infiltrates the Cylon compound and acquires the launch keys, but is stopped by D'anna, who recognizes her immediately, and tells her Hera is still alive. However, Sharon refuses to believe it. To prevent D'anna from warning the Cylons, Sharon incapacitates her by knee-capping her. Having heard the launch keys have been retrieved, Admiral William Adama (Edward James Olmos) starts preparation for battle. He instructs his son Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama (Jamie Bamber) to wait for 18 hours. Should Adama fail to arrive in time, Apollo should lead the remainder of the fleet to [[Earth]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2670">Plot

In response to the suicide bombing of a [[New Caprica]] Police (NCP) ceremony, the Cylons order a crackdown against the insurgency. Many [[resistance]] members start to disagree about the legitimacy of the [[suicide bombings]], but leader Colonel Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) continues to orchestrate them. In an attempt to get Kara &quot;[[Starbuck]]&quot; Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) to love him, Leoben Conoy (Callum Keith Rennie) presents her with a toddler named Kacey (Madeline Parker), whom Leoben claims Starbuck is the mother, having been born as a result of her time on Caprica in &quot;The Farm&quot;. Leoben leaves her alone with the toddler, but Starbuck refuses to play with her. When she leaves Kacey unattended however, Kacey injures herself falling down the stairs. As Kacey is recovering, Starbuck has a change of heart and prays to the [[Kobol|Lords of Kobol]] not to let her die.

In a move against the insurgency, the Cylons decide to have the NCP arrest 200 civilians they believed to be affiliated with the resistance. Headed by James &quot;Jammer&quot; Lyman (Dominic Zamprogna), most of the arrests take place during the night. Those being arrested include Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch) and Cally Henderson Tyrol (Nicki Clyne). After another suicide bombing at a power station, the Cylons decide to have the prisoners executed, but require President Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) signature. When he refuses to sign, an Aaron Doral (Matthew Bennett) copy forces him to at gunpoint. [[Caprica-Six ]](Tricia Helfer) attempts to stop him, but Doral shoots her in the head. Baltar signs the document. Meanwhile, Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon) learns from Cavil (Dean Stockwell) that he only released her husband Saul (Michael Hogan) because the Cylons know he is leading the resistance. He informs Ellen that unless she tells the Cylons where the resistance leaders will be meeting next, he will imprison Saul once more. Reluctantly, Ellen gets hold of where the resistance plan to meet with members from the colonial fleet.

On board Galactica, Admiral William Adama (Edward James Olmos) appoints their Cylon prisoner Sharon Agathon (Grace Park) to a Colonial officer and has her go to the planet to liaison with the resistance. When she arrives to meet with resistance members, Centurions arrive, having learned where they are from the intelligence Ellen provided them, and start attacking them. Simultaneously, the 200 human prisoners are being transported to a location by the Cylons and NCP. A masked Jammer, realizing they are to be executed, saves Cally by releasing her in secret and telling her to run. As she runs away, the sound of gunfire is heard.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="674">In the miniseries, Doral appears as a public relations worker for the abortive Battlestar Galactica museum. In the episode &quot;[[Litmus]]&quot;, another copy of Doral sneaks on board the Galactica and detonates an explosive. This event prompts the fleet-wide announcement that Cylons can have a human appearance. He was revealed to be the 5th model in the episode &quot;[[Downloaded]]&quot;.

During the Occupation of [[New Caprica]], the Fives seem to be one of the most anti-human and aggressive models. As a series, the Fives seem to specialise in public relations and control, using large scale events and media manipulation to their advantage.

Number Fives are played by Matthew Bennett</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2569">Ragnar

Ragnar is the second largest planet in all of the Twelve Colonies's star systems and is a gas giant that orbits both the Helios Gamma and Helios Delta star systems, having been dislodged from its former orbit in the Helios Gamma system by the planet Ophion. During the &quot;Miniseries&quot;, then-Commander Adama takes the Galactica there for supplies and weapons from the Ragnar Anchorage, which was in low orbit around the planet. Ragnar's natural radiation was discovered to be damaging to the Cylons, who avoided the planet and allowed the refugee fleet to hide here temporarily before fleeing the system. Ragnar's atmosphere is mined for its plentiful hydrocarbons that are used at the weapons depot that orbits it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ragnar Anchorage

Ragnar Anchorage is a Colonial munitions depot suspended in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant Ragnar. The Colonial Fleet learned that the atmosphere of the planet Ragnar emitted a kind of radiation that adversely affected Cylon technology and cloaked ships residing within the storm. When the Cylons launch their attack on the Twelve Colonies, the Battlestar Galactica was without any munitions for her main and point-defence batteries, having dumped them as part of her decommissioning ceremonies prior to the battle. Colonel Saul Tigh determined that Ragnar Anchorage offers the best opportunity for re-arming the ship, based on its listing in an old directory of military supply depots.

While at Ragnar Anchorage, Galactica obtained enough munitions to completely re-arm her guns, and she also collected a number of Class-D warheads (the capabilities of which are not described but presumably are very powerful weapons, possibly nuclear). Her crew also encountered the Leoben Conoy Cylon model, posing as an arms trader, who eventually gave the Colonials their first discovery of humanoid Cylon infiltrators. Galactica is joined by a civilian convoy of survivors gathered by President Laura Roslin. When they arrive, then-Commander William Adama was persuaded to alter his original plan to send Galactica into a suicidal fight against the Cylons into one of exodus from the Colonies to save the last of humanity.

Galactica protected the civilian fleet as they made an FTL jumps from Ragnar towards the Promar Sector, well beyond the &quot;Red Line&quot; of charted space, never to return to the solar system of the Colonies in an effort to escape the Cylons. Soon after the battle, the Cylons dock at the station to retrieve the Cylon agent Aaron Doral, who was exiled at the station on the orders of Commander Saul Tigh.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5151">Doral is a humanoid Cylon (designated model [[Number Five]])[1] who first appeared as a civilian public relations specialist aboard Galactica just prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies. Through conversation with the projection of Cylon agent Number Six, Dr. Gaius Baltar notices a Cylon Device attached to Galactica's [[DRADIS]] station and convinces himself Doral is responsible, as he can freely enter the room while not having much business in it; he claims he has lab test evidence that Doral is a Cylon spy and has him thrown in the brig. He can then justify the finding of the Cylon device, alleging that the prisoner seemed very interested in that piece of equipment. Doral emphatically denies being a Cylon and claims to be from the village of [[Oasis]], outside [[Caprica City]], and having been on Kobol College on Gemenon. However, not willing to take a chance, Doral is abandoned by Commander Adama on the [[Ragnar Anchorage ]]weapons depot before the fleet leaves the system. The audience is shown that Baltar was correct in assuming Doral a Cylon, as a copy of Doral, along with several copies of [[Number Six]], Leoben Conoy, and Sharon come to his rescue. (In the novelization, Doral is a sleeper agent - he does not know he is a Cylon until the others come for him at Ragnar Anchorage.)

Doral appears again on Cylon-occupied Caprica curiously monitoring the situation developing between Sharon and Karl &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon. He initially decides that Sharon cannot be trusted, and orders Number Six to deal with her. Once Doral discovers that Sharon is pregnant, he states the child is a miracle, and must be protected at all costs. The discovery also leads to his suggesting a major tactical change, although the details of this new plan, as well as whatever changes were made from the original, have as yet to be clearly defined in the series.

The Doral Cylons seem to act more covertly, having an unassuming &quot;average&quot; appearance in order to better blend in with more trivial background matters instead of taking more noticeable positions of authority and purpose. He seems to have a position of authority among the Cylons, acting as overseer, and having a hand behind their decision making and tactical planning.[citation needed] This personalization is contradicted, however, in the special TV movie &quot;[[The Plan]],&quot; in which a copy of [[Number One]]/John Cavil berates a confused Doral copy (wearing clothing nearly identical to the first copy encountered by the Colonials) for his lack of disguise and caution while wandering the halls of Galactica. A later scene shows a small group of Doral copies assigned to menial labor disposing of masses of human corpses on occupied Caprica, doing work they complain is below them and should be handled by Centurions. Likewise, in the episode &quot;[[Downloaded]],&quot; a copy of Doral can be seen serving drinks to other humanoid Cylons. These scenes seem to imply the Doral models are of lower intelligence than other Cylon models, and possess less authority. Of the several Cylon infiltrators whose failures are listed by Cavil and &quot;Tough Six&quot;, including the [[Number Eight]] known as Lieutenant Jr. Grade Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii, the Number Two known as Leoben Conoy, the Number Six known as Shelly Godfrey, and the Number Four known as Simon O'Neill, Doral is the only one whose failure to complete the Cylon plan was not due to love but simply to blowing himself up before reaching a critical area of Galactica.[citation needed]

The Doral Cylons appear to be more fanatical, militant and cold-hearted than the other humanoid Cylons encountered thus far, short of the often vile, overtly vicious Brother Cavil.[citation needed] They calmly discuss the genocide of mankind (stating on one occasion &quot;They [humans] would have destroyed themselves anyway. They deserve what they got.&quot;), and unhesitatingly conducting (on at least one occasion) a suicide bombing aboard Galactica.[2] On the other hand, Doral was highly critical of the human suicide bombers in &quot;Occupation&quot; who inflicted Cylon casualties and fatalities, lambasting them for a 'lack of nobility'. Doral's violence is such that he held a gun to Gauis Baltar's head and forced him to sign a document allowing mass executions. He then murdered a copy of Six when she tried to stop him, proving that Doral is deeply hypocritical in his belief. In &quot;Torn&quot; a Number Eight accuses Doral of &quot;barely even being able to say [God's] name.&quot; Number Fives are the only humanoid Cylon model not shown in a romantic or sexual relationship at some point in the series, although a Five in the episode &quot;[[Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down]]&quot; &quot;can't help wondering&quot; what it would be like to feel as intensely as Helo does for Sharon, noting that &quot;even in his anguish&quot;, after [[Sharon]] was taken away as part of a trial of Helo's love, &quot;he seemed so... alive&quot;, and a Five speaking with former Galactica deckhand James &quot;Jammer&quot; Lyman in detention on New Caprica in a Battlestar Galactica: The [[Resistance]] webisode tells Jammer that &quot;a wife, kids, a life&quot; is possible for him, and for the Five himself and &quot;all of us&quot;, if he starts cooperating with the Cylons</text>

&lt;br /&gt;The &quot;Final Five&quot; Cylons drawn in a crude sketch by Number Three

In the episode &quot;Torn&quot;, Gaius Baltar questions [[Number Six]] as to why only seven humanoid models appeared on New Caprica and why he has seen only these same seven aboard the Basestar when she had told him previously that there were twelve models. Six replies that the Cylons do not talk about the other five models. Baltar has become worried that he may in fact be a Cylon himself and presses her on whether she would recognize one of the &quot;Final Five&quot;, as he names them. Their conversation ends abruptly, leaving the truth of the other models unknown.

In the episode &quot;Hero&quot;, [[Number Three]] has a dream immediately after she dies, where she sees five glowing figures. Later, in the episode &quot;The Passage&quot;, she tries to hold on to the memory of their faces and draws pictures of them soon after downloading, but the memories fade and the drawings are too surrealistic to be of practical use. It is clear that she does not consciously know what the Final Five look like. In the episode &quot;Rapture&quot;, D'Anna and Baltar reach the [[Eye of Jupiter]] and [[D'Anna]] receives a vision of the Final Five. She seems to recognize one of them, but the vision is cut short before the viewers see any detail of the figures. The shock kills her and upon awakening after downloading, she mentions her experience to [[Cavil]]. He confirms that the seven known Cylon models do not know who the Final Five are and that the pursuit of that information is strictly forbidden by their programming. As punishment for this and for other acts, Cavil then terminates her and her entire model is &quot;boxed&quot;, taking the secret of the Final Five with her until she is unboxed.

In &quot;[[Crossroads]]&quot;, four of the final five Cylons are revealed to themselves, each other, and the audience, though not to the human characters. [[Samuel T. Anders]] (Michael Trucco), [[Galen Tyrol ]](Aaron Douglas), [[Tory Foster]] (Rekha Sharma), and [[Saul Tigh]] (Michael Hogan) begin hearing the same hallucinatory music that no one else can perceive (a version of &quot;[[All Along the Watchtower]]&quot;). When the music draws them towards each other, a &quot;switch goes off&quot; in their minds and they realize that they are all Cylons. They resolve, nevertheless, to continue doing their duty as part of the fleet. The identity of the fifth and final Cylon remains unknown even to them. Their &quot;awakening&quot; seems to affect other Cylons as well, as in the episode &quot;[[He That Believeth In Me]]&quot;, a Cylon Raider scans Anders then disengages the attack; in the same episode, aboard Galactica, Caprica Six tells Roslin that she can feel the Final Five and that they are near. It is later revealed in &quot;[[Six of One]]&quot; that the Twos, Sixes and Eights believe that the Raiders called off the attack because they sensed the Final Five, something the Ones, Fours, and Fives disagree with. Cavil further claims that their original programmers programmed the seven Cylon models not to seek that information out. This disagreement leads directly to the Cylon Civil War, in which the Twos, Sixes, and Eights become known as the rebel faction. In &quot;[[Revelations]]&quot;, an unboxed D'Anna reveals that only four of the Final Five are within the Colonial Fleet, and confirms that Tigh, Tyrol, Anders, and Foster are those four Cylons. A standoff between Galactica and the rebel Baseship results in the four being exposed as Cylons to the rest of the human Fleet, but Lee Adama, in his capacity as acting President, grants them amnesty as part of an alliance between the Fleet and the rebel Cylons.

Ronald D. Moore confirmed in an interview that the four are indeed fully Cylon — although &quot;fundamentally different&quot; from the others. Moore has also stated that unlike the other Humanoid Cylon models, the Final Five do not have model numbers.This is because in their original lives they were born to Cylon parents through sexual reproduction, rather than being built, as stated in &quot;[[No Exit]]&quot;.

In &quot;[[Sometimes a Great Notion]]&quot;, it is revealed that all of the Final Five had previous lives on Earth, 2000 years in the past, as part of the [[Thirteenth Tribe]]. Cylon testing procedures used on the tribe's remains reveal that they were all humanoid Cylons. As each of the Final Four explores the ruins, each begins to regain small memory fragments of their past life. It is when Saul Tigh remembers a snippet of his previous life that he discovers that his late wife, Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon), must be the fifth and final Cylon, because she was present on Earth 2000 years ago as well. During Saul's flashback, his wife insinuates that she had foreknowledge of the destruction of Earth when she states that plans have been made for her and Saul to be reborn.

In &quot;No Exit&quot; Ellen Tigh is revealed to have resurrected onboard one of the [[Resurrection Ship, Part II|Resurrection Ship]]s in the Cylon fleet after her poisoning, and to have subsequently been held prisoner by Cavil on a Basestar for 18 months. The past of the Final Five is also revealed: they lived on Earth 2000 years ago and were researchers in rebuilding Cylon resurrection technology, which had been abandoned when the Thirteenth Tribe gained the ability to procreate. Saul and Ellen were married even back then, while Tyrol and Foster were in love and had plans to get married. The five learned of the upcoming holocaust from beings only they could see and worked to rebuild Resurrection. They succeeded and placed it on a ship, which they left in orbit of Earth. When the nuclear attack happened and they were killed (according to the series' writers, the cataclysm was an uprising of Earth's own Centurions that apparently destroyed both sides), they were reborn in new bodies on that ship in orbit. The Five then headed for the Colonies to warn them about making artificial life, but the trip took thousands of years due to there being no FTL drive on their ship. Due to traveling at near light speed, time dilation made it seem like less than that to them. They arrived during the first war, unbeknownst to the humans, and made a deal with the Centurions: stop the war and they would help them build human bodies. Thus the Final Five ended the First Cylon War. They built Number One, Cavil, and he helped them build seven other models, but after Ellen began to favour Number Seven, Cavil permanently destroyed the [[Number Seven]] line by contaminating the production. Ultimately Cavil locked the Final Five in a compartment and evacuated the oxygen, killing them. He then boxed them and apparently removed the memory of their identities from the other Cylons. He later unboxed and resurrected them, but first blocked their true memories and implanted false ones. Cavil periodically seeded them among the human populations starting with Saul, and then Ellen, to show them how bad humanity supposedly was. This shows that Cavil's claim that not seeking out the Final Five was a directive from the Cylons' original programmers was a lie, and that he was only pretending not to be aware of their identities himself. Ironically, the &quot;Final Five&quot; are in fact the first five humanoid Cylons to encounter the Colonials and the new Cylon Centurions after the Thirteenth Tribe's diaspora. Of the Five, only Anders and Ellen regain their true memories: when Anders gets shot in the head, it seems to break Cavil's block on his memory and Ellen's resurrection in a new body restores all of her memories. It is also revealed in The Plan that the Cavils planned for the Five to die in the destruction of the Colonies, download, regain their true memories and apologize for their faith in humanity. Despite the Cavils' hopes, the Final Five survived the destruction of the Colonies without resurrecting (which the Cavils hadn't believed possible) and Cavil even keeps Ellen alive so she can suffer more and learn her &quot;lesson&quot;. The Cavils' hopes that the Five learn a &quot;lesson&quot; is shown not to have worked, as all of the Five (except maybe Tory Foster) maintain their loyalty to humanity even after the truth comes out.

Similar to their role in ending the First Cylon War, the Final Five have a major role in ending the second war. During the Battle of The Colony, the Five take a prominent role in the battle, especially Anders who, acting as Galactica's Hybrid, shuts down the Colony's weapons and Hybrids. The Five also nearly bring a peace between human and Cylon by exchanging Resurrection technology (which can only be rebuilt by the Five combining their knowledge together) for peace. However, a side-effect of the connection they make is they see each other's memories, and Tyrol learns that Foster murdered his wife. In response, he strangles her, and the temporary peace is shattered. Later, Anders flies the fleet into Earth's Sun, destroying the fleet and himself, leaving only three of the Final Five alive. As the [[Resurrection Hub]] had been destroyed, their deaths are permanent</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2951">The episode begins directly after the cliffhanger of the previous episode, where Kara Thrace holds Laura Roslin at gunpoint to stop her from going to what she thinks is the wrong way to Earth. Meanwhile, some of the Humanoid Cylon models wish to lobotomize the Raiders to make them destroy the fleet, regardless if the final five are among the fleet. However, the other Cylon models, particularly Natalie (a Six model) wish to stop them by any means necessary. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,676

Plot

Kara Thrace holds President Laura Roslin at gunpoint and reminds her that she once followed orders from Roslin to find Earth. Now that Starbuck thinks she knows where Earth is, Roslin rejects it. Feeling betrayed, Starbuck tells Roslin to take the gun and shoot her if she can't trust her. Roslin does pick up the gun and just as security arrives she fires and misses. Starbuck is quickly taken to the brig but urges everyone to change course. She fears that she will lose her directions to Earth forever if they make one more jump. Admiral Adama confronts her, telling her she has lost all hope of anyone helping her. After Starbuck accuses Adama of ignoring her on purpose, Adama furiously slams her to the deck then leaves in disgust. Later, the fleet makes another jump, and Starbuck loses her direction of Earth.

The Cylon models prepare to lobotomize the Raiders to forget about the Final Five as their identities are forbidden by their programming. They vote but it ends in a draw ([[Number One]], [[Number Four]] and [[Number Five]] votes for, and [[Numbers Two|Number Two]], [[Number Six]] and [[Number Eight]] voting against). Boomer is the only Eight model to vote for the lobotomizing. To prevent this from happening, one of the Six models (known as Natalie) removes the higher brain inhibitors from the Centurions which gives them free will. They proceed to kill all of the One, Four and Five models in the room.

Lee Adama leaves Galactica to start his new political career, but not before telling Starbuck that he believes her. The four Cylons (Colonel Tigh, Tory Foster, Samuel Anders, and Galen Tyrol) meet in secret to discuss who they think is the fifth Cylon. Since they believe Gaius Baltar may know, Tory visits him. At first, Baltar believes she is spying on him. After having a vision of his virtual self, he and Tory talk, and later sleep together. Afterward Tory says that she could be a Cylon, but Baltar tells her not to be afraid and that he has learned from his time among them that Cylons have feelings. He says that humans may have created the Cylons, but it was the one true God that gave them souls. Adama and Roslin discuss what to do with Starbuck. Though Roslin has objections, Adama eventually decides to let Starbuck go. In the end, she is taken to a hangar, where to her surprise, she is given a ship, the [[Demetrius]] and a team including Helo, Athena, Anders and Gaeta to find Earth</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1103">Number Four (Simon O'Neill)&lt;br /&gt;

Simon first appears in the episode &quot;[[The Farm]]&quot;, posing as a human physician treating Starbuck for a gunshot wound in what was supposedly a resistance hospital on Caprica. In reality this was a Cylon &quot;farm&quot; set up to breed human-Cylon hybrids using captured humans, and he was also performing invasive tests on her reproductive organs. After Starbuck began to suspect Simon's true nature and killed him, she escaped from the facility and her fears were confirmed when a second copy of the model greeted her on her way out. He was revealed to be the 4th model in the episode &quot;[[Six of One]]&quot;. Fours are consistently the Cylons' medical specialists.

Another Number four appeared in [[The Plan]], posing as a married man in the Colonial Fleet. Cavil at one point asks Simon to leave his life behind and destroy the ship he lives on. He defies this order in order to protect his wife and her child by committing suicide and flying out of an air lock. He was not close enough to a Resurrection Ship and therefore died permanently.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3352">Number Eight (Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii / Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon)&lt;br /&gt;
[[Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii]] first appears as a Raptor pilot aboard the Galactica. Her true nature as a Cylon was only revealed at the end of the miniseries, and the series quickly establishes that Sharon acted as a sleeper agent, unaware of her true nature and programmed to carry out attacks on the fleet without her human side realizing what she was doing. She was revealed to be the 8th model in the episode &quot;Downloaded&quot;.

Also interesting enough, at the end of the mini series, a number Six says &quot;By your command&quot; to an Eight. This phrase is usually spoken to the Imperious leader in the old series by Centurions. It seemed to give this particular Eight a leadership role.

The other significant copy of this model, Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon, married Karl &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon, rebelled against the Cylons and joined forces with the Colonials. Her child with Helo, a daughter named Hera, is the first Cylon/human hybrid to be born. Such a child is the subject of a Cylon prophecy and therefore very important as it was a 'child born of love'. Shortly after Hera's birth, Laura Roslin decides to mislead the Cylons into believing the child has died. Her plan involves lying to Athena and Helo, and giving the child to an adoptive mother, Maya. While aiding the Colonials in their plan to rescue the humans on New Caprica, Athena sneaks into a Cylon storage facility and steals launch codes for the civilian ships trapped on New Caprica by the Cylons. During this action, Athena is discovered by D'Anna Biers. D'Anna informs Athena that Hera is still alive, citing strange dreams and a prophecy by a human mystic as proof. Athena, believing this to be a ruse, kneecaps D'Anna. During the exodus from New Caprica, Maya is killed and the baby is found by D'Anna. Athena is later told, by Boomer, that Hera lives. Athena has Helo kill her, allowing her to download into a new body within the Cylon fleet. With the help of Caprica Six, she manages to rescue Hera and return to Galactica.

This model has been described as &quot;weak&quot; by Baltar's vision of Number Six, and Number Eights usually appear more compassionate and sympathetic than other Cylons. However, they fully supported the destruction of the Twelve Colonies; and the actions in particular of Boomer and an Eight who had a duplicitous affair with Felix Gaeta on New Caprica make it clear that Eights are capable of homicide and betrayal. Eights are also capable of intense loyalty and have the ability to break from Cylon traditions and laws to help human friends or family. They also voted to save humanity in the Cylon civil war started by Sharon (Boomer). She hesitated for a while when Cavil started to influence her, but in the end she chose to support the humans, even if it meant that she would have to give up her life. Sharon (Athena) became completely assimilated in human culture. Her child and husband became her focus in life. She seemed to be the only Cylon to accomplish a normal family existence. The model Eight's perceived fragility seems to camouflage great strength and direction. (In one episode, Sharon (Athena) was able to &quot;hard&quot; wire herself to the Galactica, hack into a Cylon fleet and shut them all down.) Eights seem to enjoy being with humans for the most part.

Number Eights are played by Grace Park.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="996">Number Two (Leoben Conoy)&lt;br /&gt;

Leoben first appears as a smuggler at the munitions depot at [[Ragnar Anchorage]], where he was exposed as a Cylon in the mini-series. The Leoben model Cylons are known for their religious zealotry, which is intertwined with a pathological, and sometimes sexual, obsession with Starbuck. He was revealed to be the second model in the episode &quot;[[Six of One]]&quot;.

Like his fellow Cylons, the Leoben models are skilled at deception and deceit. This was most notably seen when he manipulated Starbuck into thinking that a young girl he had kidnapped on New Caprica was her biological daughter. The Leoben models are known for their cunning minds and ability to find and exploit the weaknesses of others. As such, they are known to mix truth with their lies in order to better manipulate their victims. Unlike his fellows, he appears to have the ability of prescience and has on several occasions prophesied future events.

In &quot;Resistance&quot;, Tigh ordered supplies taken by force from civilian ships. On the civilian ship Gideon, Marines commanded by [[Lieutenant Joe Palladino]] opened fire on a hostile but unarmed crowd of civilians, killing four.

Biers is preparing a report on what she calls the &quot;[[Gideon|Gideon massacare]].&quot; Hoping to influence [[Biers]] to produce a more &quot;balanced&quot; report, Adama grants her unrestricted access to document life aboard Galactica.

Biers conducts frank interviews with crew members and captures some pilots' hijinks on camera. After Kat overdoses on stimulants and botches a landing, Biers follows her to Galactica's sickbay. There, she discovers [[Doctor Cottle]] treating Sharon for a complication with her pregnancy. Adama confiscates the footage, but Biers secretly keeps a copy. She then records the crew during a successful defense against incoming Cylon Raiders and uncovers a disgruntled Palladino as the perpetrator of death threats and an assassination attempt on Tigh.

In her final report, Biers describes arriving on Galactica with a bias against the crew but changing her mind. Pleased with the report, Adama recommends it be shown throughout the fleet. On Caprica, several Cylons also watch the report, as well as the secret footage of Sharon. A copy of Biers, who is apparently a Cylon, sits with them, reveals that the Raiders were called to Galactica to relay this footage, and calls the unborn child &quot;a miracle from God.&quot;</text>

The episode primarily takes place on Cylon-occupied Caprica. After the Fall of the Twelve Colonies, the copy of [[Number Six]] (Tricia Helfer) that was responsible for disabling the Colonial defence system (affectionately known as &quot;Caprica-Six&quot;) and Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii (Grace Park) were both &quot;downloaded&quot;: a standard Cylon practice of rebirth which takes place if a model is to perish, and have both been hailed as Cylon heroes due to their efforts in infiltrating human society.

Both are having difficulties in adjusting to life on Caprica. In particular, [[Caprica-Six]] is having visions of Gaius Baltar (James Callis) that only she can see, much like Baltar's visions of Caprica-Six, and Boomer is having problems accepting her Cylon nature to the point of the denial, even in danger of being &quot;boxed&quot;, which means storing a Cylon's memories without consciousness out of its body. [[Number Three ]](Lucy Lawless) asks Caprica-Six to help Boomer in this regard. However, when Caprica-Six starts to associate more with Boomer, they both realize that the holocaust the Cylons effected was a sin.

Caprica-Six and Boomer are next shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, explosives set by the resistance led by [[Samuel T. Anders]] (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica-Six is injured, so much so that Number Three tries to euthanise her before finding Anders, whom she tries to kill instead. Number Three goads the other survivors so much that Caprica-Six kills her and forms a pact with Boomer to attempt to change Cylon opinion of humans.

The episode's secondary plot takes place on Galactica. The copy of [[Number Eight]] that defected from the Cylons gives birth by cesarian section to a baby who she and [[Karl Agathon]] (Tahmoh Penikett) call &quot;[[Hera]]&quot;. However, President Laura Roslin, and her secretary, [[Tory Foster]], and Dr. Cottle conspire to fake Hera's death fearing what would happen if the Cylons knew the child lived. President Roslin also did not want Hera to be raised by her Cylon mother, Sharon, whom she still does not trust. At the end of the episode, the child is given to a woman who believes the child was born on Pegasus, while Helo and Chief Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) scatter the ashes they believe to be Hera's into space</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6246">Plot

The episode follows stories on two timelines: the current events in the Colonial fleet, and events aboard Cavil and Boomer's basestar in flashback, beginning at the end of the Cylon occupation of New Caprica, and jumping forward until it converges with the present.

In a flashback to the Cylon occupation of New Caprica, it is revealed that Ellen Tigh resurrected in the Cylon fleet after Saul poisoned her. At first, she is known only to Cavil. Ellen tries to persuade Cavil to stop chasing the humans, but he refuses, saying he wants justice for the enslavement of the Cylons that led to the First Cylon War. Ellen refers to Cavil as John, his model's original name, which he dislikes. It is revealed that he was modeled after Ellen's father.

On board the Galactica, Tyrol shows Admiral Adama the damage to the ship's hull he discovered at the end of the previous episode (see &quot;[[Blood on the Scales]]&quot;), and warns that the ship may not survive another jump without repair. Tyrol indicates that when Galactica was built, corners were cut, compromising its structural integrity. Also, the ship has taken accumulated battle damage as well as the jump into New Caprica's atmosphere which strained the ship's structural integrity. Basically the ship is dying of old age. Adama reinstates Tyrol to the rank of Chief, and asks him to fix the ship, insisting on the repair crew being all human. Repair efforts begin, but Tyrol discovers extensive micro fractures throughout the bulkheads that cannot be easily repaired, and recommends an organic Cylon compound, which Adama adamantly refuses.

As a side-effect of the bullet still lodged in his brain, Samuel Anders is able to recover memories of the complete origin and purpose of the Final Five. Three others of the Final Five and Kara Thrace gather around his bedside, begging for him to be kept out of surgery until he can finish explaining. Anders says that the Cylons, which were the thirteenth tribe of Kobol, began procreating naturally on Earth and finally lost resurrection technology. Anders and the other Final Five were researchers who worked on reinventing the ancient technology.

On Colonial One, Lee Adama proposes assembling a new Quorum. He says it should reflect the current times, representing the ships in the fleet rather than the old 12 colonies. Laura Roslin agrees, and tells him to assemble the new Quorum himself. She says she will remain as president in title, with Lee assuming the responsibilities of the office. She says her only reservation about him is that he sometimes does what is right, rather than what is smart.

In the infirmary, Sam continues his explanation. The Final Five re-developed the ancient resurrection process, and created a resurrection ship in orbit around Earth. When nuclear war destroyed the Earth Colony, the Final Five were killed but resurrected on the ship. They made their way to the Twelve Colonies with the intention of warning the humans against repeating old mistakes and provoking another war with Centurions. They lacked faster-than-light technology, so they traveled at speeds near, but below, the speed of light. In accordance with Einstein's theory of relativity, due to time dilation only a short time passed for them, while thousands of years passed for the rest of the universe. They arrived only to find that the other Colonies were already engulfed in war with their own Cylon Centurions.

The Centurions had already created the hybrid models, but nothing that could survive on its own. The Five offered to help the Centurions if, in exchange, they ended the war. The Five gave them resurrection technology and created eight humanoid models, although the fleet previously only knew of the existence of seven of them. Kara asks Sam about the eighth Cylon, designated Number Seven, thinking it might be her, but Sam tells her that it was a male named Daniel.

In another flashback, Ellen tells Cavil that she knows he killed all the Daniels [[Number Seven]], because Cavil was jealous of them. Cavil responded that the Daniels &quot;didn't thrive.&quot;

Cavil shows her images of the temple on the algae planet. Ellen says the temple wasn't her invention. It was created by the thirteenth tribe on their way from Kobol to Earth. Cavil mentions that D'Anna saw the faces of the Five in that temple, and Ellen says that was not because of anything she did. She suggested it was an act of the &quot;One God.&quot;

Cavil is resentful that the Five gave him human weaknesses. Ellen realizes that he sent the Five to live among the humans because he wanted them to suffer. Boomer asks Ellen if she feels remorse for what she did for the Cylons. She replies that she does not, because what she did was a good thing. She gave them free will and the ability to feel compassion.

Sam's doctors insist that the surgery cannot wait anymore, and they start the surgery before he's finished explaining everything. As he is being wheeled into the operating theater, he urges Saul Tigh to stay with the fleet.

In yet another flashback, Cavil informs Ellen about the destruction of the Resurrection Hub by the humans and the rebel Cylons and tells her that she will have to recreate the resurrection technology for them. She claims that she will need the other Final Five in order to do this, however Cavil does not believe her. He tells her that if she doesn't give him the information, he'll extract the information from her brain using a psychophysical process.

In a flashback to two days ago, Boomer comes to Ellen, supposedly to escort her to the surgery. Ellen tells her that she should have brought a tumbrel (a cart used to transport condemned prisoners during the French revolution), implying that Cavil's procedure is some form of punishment or execution. Boomer leads Ellen to a captured Raptor, saying she is forgiving her. They escape the basestar and then jump away.

Sam comes out of surgery and Starbuck tries to talk to him, but paramedic Ishay points out on the monitor that he has almost no brain function.

In his room, Adama notices large cracks in the bulkheads, and finally relents, calling Tyrol and telling him to do whatever it takes to save the ship, presumably including the Cylon-based biological structural reinforcements</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10718">Plot

A cold open reviews some of the events of the previous episode, Sine Qua Non. Text reading &quot;Two Days Ago&quot; picks up the story of President Laura Roslin and the other human beings aboard the damaged Cylon basestar. As the Cylon hybrid is reconnected, it cries out &quot;Jump!&quot; The ship jumps to an empty part of space. During the jump, Roslin finds herself aboard a dark, empty Galactica. Priestess Elosha, who died in the Season 2 two-part episode, Home, appears. She and Roslin embrace. Roslin admits she feels at home aboard the Galactica. The jump ends, and Roslin's vision ends. During subsequent jumps the vision reoccurs. Roslin and Elosha walk through the ship, eventually reaching the sick bay where they see a version of Roslin dying alone of her cancer. Again, the vision ends when the jump ends. The Hybrid continues to jump the basestar, and the Leader of the Number Eights theorizes that the Hybrid is completing its mission and bringing the basestar to the Hub, so that the resurrection technology of the Cylons can be destroyed.

Gaius Baltar, one of the Sixes, and an Eight believe that the Hybrid is panicking. Baltar's attempts to talk to the Hybrid seem to calm it somewhat, but Roslin's attempts to do the same do not. Baltar criticizes Roslin for speaking &quot;at&quot; the Hybrid rather than to it. Roslin attempts to calm the Hybrid again, speaking to it more humanely, and the Hybrid seems to calm down even further.

The jumps continue, as do Roslin's visions during the jumps. Roslin and Elosha discuss death and dying. The periods between jumps become somewhat lengthy. During one such period, Capt. Karl &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon discusses the misson with the Leader of the Eights. He and the Eight conclude that only by using the Galactica's Viper ships—several of which were trapped aboard the basestar when it jumped away from the Colonial Fleet—can they hope to destroy the Hub. They conceive a plan. When Helo shows signs of stress, the Eight massages his shoulders just as his wife, Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon has done. Helo is surprised at her actions, but the Eight reveals that she downloaded many of Athena's memories after Athena used the resurrection ship technology (an event which occurred during the Season 3 episode, Rapture). Helo finds himself emotionally drawn to the Eight.

Aboard the Hub, the Cylon known as Brother Cavil &quot;unboxes&quot; or reactivates the Number Three known as D'Anna Biers. All Number Threes were deactivated and their memories isolated and stored in the third season episode Rapture. But now Cavil uses the resurrection technology to reactivate Biers. Cavil reveals that civil war has broke out among the Cylons, with the Eights, Sixes and Twos opposing the Fours, Fives and Ones. Biers is surprised to see Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii having defected to join the Ones. Biers expresses surprise that Cavil does not want to know the identity of the Final Five Cylons. Cavil says his mind has not changed on that subject, and that the identity of the Final Five must remain hidden. He merely wants to know if Biers and the Threes will help end the civil war.

Meanwhile, Roslin continues to communicate with the Hybrid during periods between jumps. Baltar asserts that only he can communicate with it, but Roslin seems able to glean information from it as well. Roslin tries to learn about her dream in which she and Athena run through an opera house in pursuit of the half-human/half-Cylon hybrid child, Hera Agathon, only to have a Six and Baltar pick up the girl and leave through a closed door. Although the Hybrid appears to give Roslin more clues, it quickly senses the re-activation of the Threes. This creates alarm among the humans and Cylons aboard the damaged basestar, infusing them with a sense of urgency.

During another jump, Roslin and Elosha witness Admiral William Adama, Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama who is comforting Capt. Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace, and Dr. Cottle standing a deathwatch over Roslin. Adm. Adama seems very distressed over Roslin's impending death, and Roslin and Elosha discuss what it means to die, and to die alone.

When the jump is over, Helo and the Leader of the Eights tell Roslin and the Leader of the Sixes about their plan. The Cylon Raiders and Cylon Heavy Raiders will attack any basestars around the Hub, and disable the Hub's jump drive. Meanwhile, the Vipers—all electronics and engines turned off in order to avoid detection — will be towed into battle by several Heavy Raiders. Once they close with the Hub, the Cylons will free the Vipers. The Leader of the Eights and Helo will board the Hub and kidnap the Three. Once they are clear, the Vipers will use nuclear weapons to destroy the Hub. After the meeting, President Roslin tells Helo that he must bring the Three to her first so that she can learn the names of the Final Five Cylons hiding among the humans in the Colonial Fleet. She tells him that she must know the names of the Final Five first, and that only the human race can know the way to Earth. Helo disagrees, arguing this is a betrayal of the trust they have built with the Cylons. Roslin tells him that he must put aside his feelings for the Eights and follow orders, or she will remove him from the mission. Helo agrees to do as she asks.

Roslin continues to try to talk to the Hybrid. The Hybrid's vocalizations soon lead the Cylons and humans to realize that the Number Six model known as Natalie is either wounded or dying back aboard the Galactica. This leads to murmurs of distrust among the Cylons.

Helo and the Leader of the Eights discuss the Viper towing plan with the Cylon and human pilots. Many of the human pilots express dismay, arguing that their ships will be defenseless before the Cylons. Lt. Eammon &quot;Gonzo&quot; Pike in particular is vocal about his anger and distrust of the plan. His complaints lead to several rejoinders by the Cylon pilots, especially the Sixes. But the Eight and Helo point out that the Cylon pilots will be fighting and dying as well. The Eight points out that there is no alternative plan, and that if the plan succeeds then the human pilots will have destroyed Cylon resurrection technology forever. This appeases the disgruntled pilots, human and Cylon.

The damaged basestar jumps to the Hub's location. Once more, Roslin has a vision during the jump. Still at her own deathbed, she and Elosha talk more about death. Elosha says that everyone values their life, even bad people like Baltar. Life is too precious for any one person to decide whether to take another's life, she counsels Roslin. Roslin has difficulty believing her. Elosha says that is because Roslin has not allowed herself to feel in a long time, nor to love. Roslin watches Adama weep over her dead body, and her face softens.

After the jump, battle ensues. On board the hub, Biers takes the opportunity to kill Brother Cavil, and Boomer flees. Helo and the Leader of the Eights board the Hub and leave with Biers. The Viper pilots are freed on cue, and destroy the Hub with nuclear missiles once Helo, the Leader of the Eights and D'Anna are safely away. Also, one of the two enemy Basestars is destroyed in the Hub's explosion accounting for the destroyed Basestar detected in the previous episode. During the battle, Baltar encounters a Centurion. He begins to speak to the Centurion, telling it about his beliefs in a Cylon God, the seeming enslavement of the Centurions by the humanoid models, and the need for the Centurions to take control. As the Centurion seems to become angry, a weapon strikes the Cylon basestar. The Centurion is destroyed in the explosion, and Baltar is wounded in the stomach (bleeding heavily).

Roslin discovers Baltar in the damaged corridor, and drags him to safety in another room. She puts a field dressing on his belly wound, and injects him with morphine for the pain. As Baltar becomes less lucid due to the drug, he tells Roslin that he carried an incredible guilt which the Cylon monotheistic god has taken away from him. An incredulous and shaken Roslin listens as Baltar tells her that he gave the Cylons the defense codes which led to the genocide against the human race. Baltar justifies his actions by saying that the book of Pythia tells of a Noahic-like flood which reinvigorated the human race. No one blamed the flood, Baltar says; likewise, he is just a flood, and no one should blame him. As Baltar slips toward unconsciousness, Roslin removes his field dressing. Baltar begins to bleed to death. Out in space in the battle, Lt. Pike declares that he is not going to put his faith in the Cylons any more, and that he has programmed his Raptor to jump repeatedly until it reaches the Fleet again. The other human pilots tell him not to flee. An enemy Cylon Raider attacks his ship, and a bullet pierces the front window of his ship, mortally wounding him. Pike manages to jump his ship (the results of his jump are seen in the previous episode, Sine Qua Non). The rebel Cylons and humans land about the damaged basestar, and it jumps to safety shortly thereafter.

During the jump away from the Hub, Roslin is deeply moved to see herself die. Adama weeps as Roslin's life ends. He says he will no longer be selfish and fight to keep her alive. As he prays that she finds true rest, he removes his wedding ring and puts it on Roslin's finger.

The jump ends. Helo takes Biers to see Roslin. The Eight tries to stop him, telling him that this is a violation of their trust and the pact the Cylons had with the human beings. But Helo tells her that he's &quot;just following orders,&quot; and leaves with the Three.

Roslin finds herself across the room from Baltar. Realizing she may have ended his life, she rushes to put a new field dressing on his wound, and attaches an I.V. bag of fluids to his arm to help him overcome shock. Helo and Biers arrive. Biers rushes to Baltar's side, and finds that he is still alive. She announces he will live, and Roslin is relieved.

Roslin orders Helo to leave them alone, and she asks Biers for the identities of the Final Five. Biers declares that Roslin is herself a Cylon. Roslin is shocked, but then the Three bursts out laughing. She says that was a lie, and that she has no intention of revealing the identities of the Final Five until the basestar reaches the Fleet and safety.

The basestar jumps back to the position the Colonial Fleet had occupied before its jump at the end of the previous episode, Sine Qua Non. William Adama, reading in his Colonial Raptor and waiting for the basestar's return, quickly powers up his ship and flies toward the basestar. He and Roslin greet one another on the basestar's flight deck. They embrace, and Roslin tells him that she loves him. Adama responds that it's &quot;about time&quot;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12097">The opening scenes of The Plan occur just prior to the destruction of the Twelve Colonies in the televised miniseries, Battlestar Galactica. Humanoid Cylon John Cavil (played by Dean Stockwell) is shown leading the planning for the genocidal attack on the human race. All of the six &quot;known&quot; humanoid Cylons (Cavil, Leoben Conoy, D'Anna Biers, Simon, Aaron Doral, Six, and Sharon Valerii) are present in the control room of the main Cylon base. Two versions of Cavil are shown in a Resurrection Ship, with the &quot;Final Five&quot; Cylons in stasis in resurrection chambers. The two versions of Cavil briefly discuss their plans for &quot;teaching a lesson&quot; to the Final Five (who were their creators), and one version of Cavil announces his intention to witness the destruction of humanity on the ground. This version of Cavil travels to the planet Picon, where he encounters Ellen Tigh (one of the Final Five, played by Kate Vernon) in a strip club. Other characters from the series are also depicted: Gaius Baltar (James Callis) has a final meeting with Caprica Six; Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco) is shown at his Pyramid team's training camp along with the team doctor, who is Number Four/Simon (Rick Worthy); and Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) is shown driving to an airport in an SUV-type vehicle.

The destruction of the Twelve Colonies is depicted in a series of new special effects shots, with the Cylon Hybrid seemingly narrating the destruction in a typically convoluted but poetic way. Almost all of the planets of the Twelve Colonies are depicted in short scenes. Ellen Tigh is severely wounded in the nuclear attack on Picon, and Cavil helps her leave the planet aboard a Colonial Fleet rescue ship as he feels she still hasn't learned her lesson yet and thus cannot download and regain her memories. Aboard a civilian transport, Cavil torments the half-conscious woman with descriptions of his intent to destroy humanity.[4] Tory Foster survives the nuclear attack as well, and is wounded when her car flips over in the blast, but seems to protect her enough to survive. Anders helps console his teammates in the mountainous region where they were training. Several scenes from the television miniseries are edited into The Plan, notably shots of: Colonial One in space; Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) helping survivors board Colonial One; Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) and Colonel Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) responding to the attack on the Twelve Colonies. Another Number Four/Simon is shown to hold a job as Colonial Fleet medic, and has a wife named Giana and a stepdaughter named Jemmy.

In a scene from the end of the miniseries, Commander Adama enters his quarters to find a note informing him that there are only twelve Cylon models. A cut to Baltar implies that he left the note.

Cavil later boards the Galactica itself, where he is mistaken for a priest. Calling himself &quot;Brother Cavil,&quot; he takes over the Galactica's chapel. The creation of Galactica's &quot;wall of remembrance&quot; where survivors posted pictures and mementos of their dead or missing loved ones is depicted. Using religious fliers which talk about a &quot;plan&quot;, Cavil covertly gathers the other cylons: two Sixes, one who is Shelly Godfrey (Tricia Helfer), a Number Five (Matthew Bennett) and a Number Two (Callum Keith Rennie). Cavil tells them that he intends to continue his plan to utterly destroy the human race. He also tells them that there is a sleeper agent aboard the Galactica, a Number Eight (Grace Park), whom he also plans to use.

Back on Cylon-occupied Caprica, Sam Anders and his teammates have fled their training center for more safe quarters. They spot Cylon Centurions collecting the parts of their fallen comrades. Later, Sam and his companions, having taken up refuge in an old military compound in the mountains, launch their first attack on the Cylons, losing several people in the successful attack.[5] Sam and Jean Barolay later observe several Number Fives burying numerous dead human bodies, realize that Cylons have taken humanoid form, and resolve to attack them. They do so later, while a Cavil version supervises the Fives' work. Cavil plays dead and survives the attack unharmed. Mistakenly believing Cavil to be a human being, Sam and his friends take the &quot;priest&quot; with them back to their camp while Cavil is clearly shocked to see Anders.

Back on the Galactica, the events of the first season episodes are depicted, in part.[6][7][8][9] Using an elephant figurine, Brother Cavil triggers the original Cylon programming of the Number Eight known as Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii. Cavil meets with Boomer to discuss ways in which she might cripple the Galactica, and Boomer comes up with a plan to bomb the ship's water storage facilities. As she tries to implement her plan, Boomer becomes increasingly distraught because she has fallen in love with Chief Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas). Some of the previously unknown backstory of &quot;Water&quot; is depicted. Cavil becomes angry when the Number Five known as Aaron Doral is exposed as a Cylon. He demands that the Number Five he has been meeting with attempt to kill Commander Adama. He does so (as depicted in the events in the episode &quot;Litmus&quot;). The Number Two, meanwhile, works to listen in on Colonial Fleet communications, and becomes convinced that Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) holds some special purpose for the humanoid Cylons. He begins to paint the nebula depicted in Season Three episodes.[10] Cavil, realizing that the Number Two known as Leoben Conoy has had his identity compromised (as depicted in the events of the miniseries during the Galactica's re-arming trip to Ragnar Anchorage), demands that the Number Two turn himself over to the humans and attempt to deceive or kill them. He does so (as depicted in scenes from the episode &quot;Flesh and Bone&quot;). When Boomer's plan to deprive the Fleet of water fails (and Boomer actually helps the Galactica locate more water), Cavil demands that Boomer kill Commander Adama. She first attempts suicide, and later purposefully botches the assassination attempt.[11] Cavil, worried about Dr. Baltar's attempt to develop a Cylon detection machine, orders the Number Six known as Shelly Godfrey to frame Baltar for treason. She does so, but her attempt fails when she purposefully turns an amateurishly manipulated series of security tapes over to Commander Adama.[12] Her identity compromised, Cavil orders the Six into an airlock and kills her (telling her to report back to the Cylons the Fleet's location). Cally Henderson's assassination of Boomer is depicted as well. In desperation, Cavil orders the Number Four known as Simon to destroy the ship on which he lives with his family. Distraught at the idea of killing the people he loves, Simon attempts to turn his wife against him. Overcome by guilt, he reunites with her and then commits suicide by rigging an airlock to jettison himself into space, while outside of Resurrection range.

In the aftermath of Simon's suicide, there is concern that he might have been a Cylon. But his wife, Giana, reveals that he left a suicide note. Nonetheless, when Simon is revealed by Kara Thrace to be a Cylon [13] Giana seeks solace from Chief Tyrol—who is beginning to suspect that he himself might be a Cylon.[14]

Meanwhile, back on Cylon-occupied Caprica, the other version of Cavil has ingratiated himself with Sam Anders. Cavil has ordered the Number Four to attempt to kill members of Sam's team, but none have died and Cavil criticizes the Four's actions. Cavil himself tries to undermine Sam's fragile psychological well-being, but Sam rejects Cavil's counsel. Starbuck returns to Caprica and meets the stranded Colonial pilot Karl &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon.[15] The two run into Anders' team, Cavil makes a failed attempt to trick Sam into thinking they are Cylons and attacking them. Helo and Starbuck join them and attack a local Cylon base. Starbuck is wounded, taken captive by the Cylons, and subjected to various breeding experiments. Anders, Helo, and the others rescue her, discovering that Simon is a Cylon in the process.[16] Later, after Starbuck and Helo have been away from Caprica for months and return to rescue Anders' group with Galactica troops, Cavil tries to assassinate Starbuck and Anders but finds that he cannot pull the trigger of his rifle, still thinking about Anders comment that death wouldn't make him love people any less. When the Cylon Centurions attack, Cavil is forced to hide with the rest of the humans. The Centurions break off their attack. That night, Cavil sneaks from the human camp to meet with a Number Six who informs him that the Cylons have agreed to end their attacks on the human race. Cavil, who has changed his mind about humanity, agrees to pass on the message to the humans despite the Cavils voting against peace. Cavil returns to the human camp, and the humans leave the next day for the Galactica.

Meanwhile, Brother Cavil is bedeviled by the repeated appearance of a young boy named John (Alex Ferris) in his chapel. Initially, Cavil just kicks him out. But over time, Cavil appears to warm to the boy. He begins talking to him, learning the boy's name and that the boy's parents no longer want him. Cavil soon begins to feed the boy, and allows him to sleep in the chapel. One day, the boy brings Cavil the gift of an apple, and Cavil asks him if they are friends. The boy just shrugs in response. Cavil says relying on friends is dangerous and stabs him with a knife, murdering him.

The Plan ends with &quot;Caprica Cavil&quot; arriving aboard the Galactica, and unwittingly exposing himself and Brother Cavil as humanoid Cylons (as depicted in scenes from the second season episode &quot;Lay Down Your Burdens&quot;). This time it's shown that he does it on purpose to stop Brother Cavil's plans.

Brother Cavil is brought to the brig protesting that he is not a Cylon until he sees Caprica Cavil already in the brig, at which point he stops pretending. Caprica Cavil announces that the Cylons have voted to give the humans &quot;a reprieve&quot; because they have decided that their attempts at genocide were an error. They have left the colonies and will stop hunting the humans (this scene differs from the same scene in &quot;Lay Down Your Burdens, Part Two&quot;: since Mary McDonnell doesn't appear in &quot;The Plan,&quot; the Cavils's interaction with Laura Roslin, including her interrogation questions concerning what the Cylons plan to do next, is edited out, as is her order to &quot;airlock&quot; the two Cylons; the order is instead given first by Saul Tigh, and then reiterated by Commander Adama, neither one of whom had these lines in the original episode.)

The two Cavils argue while on their way to the airlock. Brother Cavil is in disbelief that the Cylons have decided to leave the humans alone, and continues to argue for their destruction. But Caprica Cavil asserts that Brother Cavil does not understand the nature of love. He says that the Final Five loved humanity, and that Brother Cavil is jealous of this love. Brother Cavil, he claims, does not understand that God and the Final Five will love humanity even more if the human race is extinguished.

As they are escorted to the airlock, the Cavils see all of the Final Five Cylons watching them. They admit that this wasn't the reunion they had expected. The two Cavils are then ejected into space. Beforehand, Brother Cavil reveals that there is a second Resurrection Ship nearby and they will download when they die. He plans to box Caprica Cavil and then destroy humanity once and for all, indicating that Galactica Cavil is in fact the same copy that was the main enemy throughout season four. Caprica Cavil quietly tells his other self that he knows how terrifying death can be, and offers his hand, which Brother Cavil takes. The two are ejected, and float out past the fleet. The film ends with this scene overlaid with John Cavil's fourth-season tirade lamenting his human-like body and desiring to be more like a machine so that he could &quot;see gamma rays, hear x-rays, smell dark matter...and feel the solar wind of a super-nova&quot; flowing over him.[17]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8012">Razor takes place during the first days of Lee Adama's Pegasus command (during the period originally covered in the second half of season 2, after the episode &quot;[[The Captain's Hand]]&quot; but before &quot;[[Lay Down Your Burdens]]&quot;) and uses flashbacks to show Rear Admiral Cain's orders during and shortly after the Cylon attack, as well as events occurring on the final day of the first Cylon War. Cain's actions in the wake of the holocaust are connected to the present by Kendra Shaw, self-described as Cain's legacy.

Events of the final day of the first Cylon war are centered on then-Lieutenant William Adama, a Viper pilot, and Helena Cain, a youngster at the time. Flashbacks of Adama discovering a lab housing the early Cylon experiments on humans as well as the first Cylon hybrid and Helena Cain abandoning her little sister during a Cylon invasion of Tauron both end as the first Cylon war ends immediately after the life-changing events, leaving each character hanging somewhat (Adama is unable to free the surviving prisoners and Cain cannot find her sister). These are shown to be driving forces for the actions of both, as the show continues. Cain goes on to teach Shaw that you have to become a 'razor' to survive during war while referring to her pocket knife, which later becomes Kendra's and then is passed on to Kara Thrace at the end of the show. Admiral Adama teaches his son Lee a different lesson: that they cannot become butchers.

Lee Adama's first priority as Pegasus commander is to restore trust and integrity to the troubled command he has taken while preserving some continuity in the leadership that had evolved under Rear Admiral Cain. He picks Kendra Shaw as his executive officer, promoting her to major, despite the stark contrast between Cain's enthusiastic praise and subsequent Pegasus officers' complaints about Kendra's performance. First boarding Pegasus less than an hour before the Cylon attack on the colonies, Shaw follows Rear Admiral Cain's order to make a &quot;blind jump&quot; that saves the ship from destruction at Scorpion Fleet Shipyards.

Kendra Shaw, as did Gaius Baltar on the Galactica, discovers that the Cylons were about to infect the Pegasus with a computer software virus which, if made operational, would have disarmed and thereby destroyed the Pegasus.

After Pegasus receives reconnaissance information that all the colonies have been destroyed, Cain delivers a rallying speech inciting the crew to war for the purpose of revenge. The crew responds by chanting &quot;So say we all!&quot; throughout the ship; the still-unexposed Number Six Cylon agent Gina Inviere awkwardly joins in.

Lee Adama's first mission as commander of Pegasus is a search and rescue mission to retrieve a lost science team. Antiquated Cylon Raiders (the ships and Cylon pilots who seem strongly reminiscent of those from the original series) from the first war appear and attack Pegasus. Simmering bitterness between Kara and Shaw is exacerbated when Shaw endangers Kara and her wingman in order to defend the battlestar. Both pilots land safely, though Kara has to destroy a Raider that follows her into Pegasus.

Later, during a heated exchange, Shaw reminds Kara that defying authority is a risky proposition aboard Pegasus, recalling how Cain shot her executive officer, Colonel Jurgen Belzen, for refusing an order to attack a Cylon staging area filled with an unexpectedly strong force of Raiders. It is during this mission that Gina Invierre helps Cylon centurions board the Pegasus and Shaw discovers Gina's true identity. It is hinted that the sadistic torture inflicted on Gina by Cain's orders had been influenced by the burgeoning romantic relationship between the Cylon and Cain. When Shaw is promoted to captain by Admiral Cain, she reminds her troubled protégé the Cylon tricked them all.

Viewing the wreckage of the raider, Sharon Valerii notes that Cylon lore tells of a group of original centurions tasked to guard the first hybrid constructed by the Cylons as a result of their human experiments. Admiral Adama then recalls his rookie mission as a Viper pilot, when he encountered that hybrid and saw what the Cylons did to their human captives in the course of their research. Admiral Adama concludes that the Cylons must still be pursuing the experiments, with the captured science team as new test subjects.

Lee Adama approves a plan to use Pegasus to find the basestar and lure the Cylon Raiders away from it, then launch a rescue team — including Kara Thrace and Kendra Shaw — outfitted with a nuclear warhead, in a Raptor. Admiral William Adama transfers his flag to Pegasus to counsel his son on his first command. The diversion succeeds; the rescue team sacrifices its Raptor and boards the basestar.

As the rescue team searches the basestar, the Cylon hybrid can be heard speaking in more coherent phrases than its more-modern counterparts. It repeatedly utters the words &quot;All this has happened before, and will happen again.&quot; The hybrid also makes a far more elaborate pronouncement:&lt;br /&gt;At last, they have come for me. I feel their lives, their destinies spilling out before me. The denial of the one true path, played out on a world not their own, will end soon enough. Soon there will be four, glorious in awakening, struggling with the knowledge of their true selves. The pain of revelation bringing new clarity. And in the midst of confusion, he will find her. Enemies brought together by impossible longing. Enemies now joined as one. The way forward at once unthinkable, yet inevitable. And the fifth, still in shadow, will claw toward the light, hungering for redemption that will only come in the howl of terrible suffering. I can see them all. The seven, now six, self-described machines who believe themselves without sin. But in time, it is sin that will consume them. They will know enmity, bitterness, the wrenching agony of one splintering into many. And then, they will join the promised land, gathered on the wings of an angel. Not an end, but a beginning.

The science team is found and partly rescued, but the rescue team comes under fire from Cylon centurions. While the team manages to evacuate the basestar in a second Raptor, the nuclear warhead is damaged and has to be detonated manually. Wounded, Shaw remains behind to detonate the warhead and comes face to face with the Cylon hybrid.

The hybrid offers absolution to Kendra, who is haunted by the fact that it was she who fired the first shot in the massacre aboard the civilian ship called Scylla as part of an operation to conscript civilians for the Pegasus. The hybrid then tells her that &quot;Kara Thrace will lead the human race to its end. She is the herald of the apocalypse, the harbinger of death. They must not follow her.&quot; Shaw tries to relay this information to Lee Adama, but is stopped when the Cylons jam communications. Her final act is to detonate the nuclear warhead, destroying the basestar.

On Galactica, Admiral Adama reflects on Cain's legacy and proposes a posthumous commendation for Kendra Shaw, over his son's protests that she and other members of Admiral Cain's crew &quot;butchered innocent civilians&quot;. They close their arguments, however, noting that history's first draft will be written in their logs, and Lee agrees to consider the commendation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2267">Description

The Raptor's primary function with the Colonial Defense Force is as an electronic warfare platform. It scouts ahead of the fleet, accompanies Vipers and provides targeting information and electronic counter measures (akin to the Prowler). Raptors can also carry external munitions to assist Vipers against large targets. Its non-combat roles include SAR (search and rescue) operations (akin to the SH-60 Seahawk) and transport of military personnel in hostile areas. Raptors, like Vipers are capable of atmospheric operations but unlike Vipers are also capable of short-range FTL jumps. Standard crew includes at least two: one pilot, and one electronic countermeasures officer (ECO).[1]

It is designed for reconnaissance, scout operations, and electronic countermeasures roles supporting Vipers, marine assaults, ambulance, EVAC, and general transport.

It has a multitude of electronic countermeasure and monitoring tools including jamming transmissions, scrambling signals of guided weapons, and Viper Identification friend or foe operations.[1]

As a scout it can operate independently or with other Raptors and Vipers using short and medium-range scans to detect radio, heat, or other signatures from spacecraft, scanning planet surfaces for life, energy output, and mineral content and location, scouting ahead and looking for hazards before its Battlestar takes an FTL jump, and search and rescue operations.

A Raptor can carry about eight to ten adults in addition to its two-person crew functioning as a transporter and can carry about eight marines including their equipment as an assault vessel. The crew of a Raptor operate using their flight suits and helmets in order to ensure their protection in case of any hull breach causing depressurization of its cabin.

It cannot takeoff from a Battlestar's launch tube like the Vipers because of its large size; it is launched from a flight pod instead. Battlestars carry squadrons of 8 to 10 Raptors and each Raptor is designated to a Viper squadron with two Raptors on reserve.

The Raptors can fly in both atmosphere and space, but in order to maintain lift in an atmosphere its engines must be constantly running which consumes more fuel. At low speeds, Raptors may experience poor handling.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6930">The Reimagined Series (2003)

During the First Cylon War, the mechanical Cylons and Humans fought to a draw. An armistice was signed and the two sides drew a border between Colonial (Human) space and Cylon space. The Cylons withdrew into their own territory to form their own society, and generally avoided any contact with Humans for the next four decades. At the edge of Human space, an Armistice Station was built to allow Humans and Cylons to meet for diplomatic relations. Each year the Humans sent an officer; the Cylons sent no one—until 40 years after the war ended, when the Cylons suddenly reappeared at Armistice Station with no warning. But now they no longer resembled machines; instead they looked exactly like ordinary Humans. The Cylons destroyed the Armistice Station, thus beginning their final assault on the [[Twelve Colonies]] and Humanity.

After destroying the Armistice Station, the Cylons launched a sneak attack against the entire Colonial fleet. Taking advantage of their immense knowledge of advanced technology, the Cylons exploited a backdoor in the Colonial military's software written into Dr. Gaius Baltar's programs by Number Six, a Cylon working undercover who had become Baltar's lover, and who deliberately used him to find weaknesses in the Colonial defense systems he had designed.

Using the knowledge they had gained from the unwitting Baltar, the Cylons were able to override the sophisticated computer systems on each battlestar and viper fighter in the fleet and shut them down, thus rendering the ships defenseless. Within a few hours virtually the entire Colonial fleet had been destroyed. Despite President Adar's &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; of the Twelve Colonies, the Cylons did not respond, and detonated nuclear bombs on each of the planets. Casualties were extreme, and within a few hours, over 50 billion humans were dead. Within 24 hours after their initial attack, only the battlestars Galactica and Pegasus had survived, although they would not learn of each other's existence for some time. The Cylons, sometime after, occupied the Twelve Colonies. The nuclear attack did irreversible damage to the planets themselves: the nukes spread out so much radiation and did so much damage that the planets were going to go into nuclear winter according to Gaius Baltar. Caprica was shown to be clearly changing just days after the attack, and any survivors needed a supply of anti-radiation medication. The once blue-green world's sky turned noticeably orange, with the trees and vegetation slowly dying from radiation. Even though the Cylons ultimately abandoned the Colonies, the humans couldn't return to their homeworlds, as they were now devastated nuclear wastelands and were now uninhabitable for a very long time (as of the present day, some 150,000 years and counting).

The Plan shows exactly what happened: after preparing a massive fleet at The Colony (Cylon base that was basically the Cylon home world and site of the final battle between Galactica and the Cylons), the Cylons jumped their fleet into the orbits of the Twelve Colonies. Three battlestars in orbit of Caprica detected them, but one of the Hybrids hacked into the Defense Mainframe using the CNP backdoor and shut it down so the people on the ground couldn't detect them and defend against them. Raiders used the CNP weakness to disable the battlestars in orbit and their fighters and then launched massive pods containing multiple (at least a dozen) nuclear missiles each at each of the Colonies. Once the pods reached a certain height, they broke open and the nuclear missiles spread out and struck their various targets, nuking the Colonies. The Cavils hoped that the Final Five would have learned their lesson about humanity, be killed in the nuclear destruction and download into new bodies on board a Resurrection Ship, but each survived the attack with Cavil even helping Ellen out as he felt she hadn't learned her lesson and needed to live among humans for longer to learn it.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Battle of Ragnar

Following the destruction of Admiral Nagala's flagship, the Battlestar Atlantia, Commander William Adama of the Battlestar Galactica ordered the remnants of the fleet to regroup at Ragnar Anchorage for a counterattack; however, with nearly the entire Colonial military fleet destroyed, it was a civilian convoy led by newly-sworn-in Colonial President Laura Roslin that responded to the orders. Facing limited options, Commander Adama chose to have the Galactica defend the convoy while each ship jumped into deep space, away from the destroyed colonies. The Galactica managed to hold off two Cylon basestars as ship after ship executed faster-than-light jumps to a safe location. When the civilian ships had jumped, the Galactica then joined them. Nevertheless, less than 50,000 Humans - out of 50 billion - had survived the holocaust. Galactica and its fleet of refugees would later find that they were not the sole survivors. At least one other battlestar, the aforementioned Pegasus, had also escaped destruction. Lt. Karl &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon and Lt. Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace would also learn that some humans had managed to survive the Cylon attack on Caprica. While this implies that at least some humans left behind by Galactica may have survived the Cylon attack and occupation of the Twelve Colonies, it is unknown if any did.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Aftermath

After the fight at Ragnar, the fleet jumped past the Red Line and into uncharted space to find a new home. Unknown to the new Fleet, they ended up with thirteen Cylons within it: the Final Five, the Cavil responsible for the destruction of the Colonies and the war that followed, two Sixes, a Doral, a Leoben, a Three, a Simon and a Sharon who was a sleeper agent on Galactica. A year later, the human fleet would link up with another survivor of the attack, the Battlestar Pegasus. Eventually the survivors discovered a habitable planet they named New Caprica and were able to settle on it for a year before being invaded by the Cylons and captured. The fleet was able to escape but not without thousands of casualties and the loss of Battlestar Pegasus under command of Commander Lee Adama.

According to Saul Tigh in Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance, twenty billion people died in the attack of the Twelve Colonies; in &quot;A Disquiet Follows My Soul&quot;, both Kara Thrace and Felix Gaeta put the number at fifty billion.

After five years of searching, the Colonials found a new world and named it Earth. Just before Earth was found, Galactica faced the Cylons in a final climactic battle and destroyed them forever. All that were left was a group of rebel Cylons that had allied with the human fleet and settled with them, while its surviving, remnant mechanical counterparts, having finally been freed by the humans and rebel Cylons to &quot;find their own destiny&quot;, would eventually leave the galaxy in peace, never to return.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21219">==Starbuck in the 2003 re-imagining==
Background

The character Kara Thrace had intended to be a professional Pyramid ball player until her knee gave out. She eventually joined the military, where she found more acceptance than she had felt at home as an abused child.[4] Although Kara's mother, Socrata Thrace, had served as a Marine Sergeant Major in the First Cylon War, Kara was the first person in the family to become a commissioned officer. Socrata was not content with her daughter's military record, however, claiming she was not disciplined enough, and she was wasting her natural talent for flying. Kara's father, Dreilide Thrace, was a piano player. He left the family when she was a child.

As a Flight Instructor at the Colonial Flight School, she met and became romantically involved with one of her students, Zak Adama. Although Zak told her he did not want any special treatment from her, Kara passed him even though he failed Basic Flight, as she could not bring herself to crush his dreams.

Her leniency cost Zak his life when he was killed on his first Viper mission. After his death, Starbuck met his father, William Adama. He realized Starbuck and Zak had been engaged and brought her under his command as a Lieutenant. Zak's death, however, created a wedge between Adama and his other son, Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama, who blamed his father for Zak's death. After the funeral, Lee broke off all contact with his father and Starbuck.

Starbuck has a natural talent for flying and is considered Galactica's best pilot, although she is also known for being an avid card player and drinker as well as for her eruptive temper. Adama loves Kara despite her flaws and considers her something of a surrogate daughter. However, Starbuck and Colonel Tigh share a mutual sense of loathing, despite their similarities. At the time of the attack on the Colonies, she was second in command of the Galactica's fighter wing.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;After the attack

In a card game prior to Galactica's decommissioning ceremony, Starbuck responds to Colonel Tigh's mocking of her call sign and her stint in the brig as a cadet by alluding to Tigh's troubled relationship with his wife. Infuriated, he flips the table over, and she punches him in the face. He sends her to the brig, promising her career is over. However, Adama tells Tigh he is probably overreacting: while he agrees to leave Kara in the brig until after the ceremony, Adama says there is no need to ruin Kara's career over the incident. Following the Cylons' attack on the Twelve Colonies, Starbuck is released to join the battle.

Starbuck keeps her secret about Zak buried inside until after the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies. Soon after, when Starbuck fears she and the rest of humanity might be wiped out by the Cylons, she confesses her mistake to Lee. He is devastated. Later, he confronts her about it when she is chosen to train new Viper pilots aboard Galactica after several pilots are killed in a freak accident. The quality of recruits she is sent is subpar but still she begins their training, ordering them to call her &quot;God&quot;. Starbuck, blinded by guilt, washes all the pilots out for relatively minor flaws. She then admits her secret to Adama who is furious and heartbroken; he orders her to reinstate the trainees.

On the next training mission, Starbuck and the trainees are ambushed by a small group of Cylon Raiders. Starbuck engages the Raiders on her own to cover the trainees' escape. With her Viper heavily damaged, she plummets toward the surface of a nearby desert moon, and is forced to eject and take her chances on the surface.

Starbuck is declared &quot;missing in action&quot;, and Adama orders a search and rescue operation which strains the Galactica's crew and combat resources. On the surface, Starbuck struggles with a broken knee and near asphyxiation as her oxygen runs out. Luckily, she discovers the Cylon Raider she downed. Using her exceptional skill in flying, she figures out the Cylon technology and is able to pilot it back to the fleet.

Depressed by her injuries, she initially needs incentive to work on rehabilitation and is soon rubbing people the wrong way again. Even after she is able to move around without a cane, the injury sidelines her from flight for many episodes; when given tactical charge of a mission in one episode, she cannot fly the critical role because her knee still can't handle the G-force.

Despite her often crude exterior, Starbuck has a deep-seated faith in the gods. As a result, President Laura Roslin asks her to carry out a dangerous mission: return to Caprica and retrieve the Arrow of Apollo, a religious artifact supposedly pointing the way to Earth. She takes the Cylon Raider she had captured, leading Adama to declare Roslin had suborned mutiny; he sends a detachment of Marines to terminate her presidency.

During her time on Caprica, Starbuck encounters Number Six (who beats her soundly); meets up with Karl Agathon and the Sharon Valerii copy pregnant with his child; and meets a fellow pyramid player named Samuel Anders. He leads a resistance group that had been waging guerrilla war against the Cylons. At one point Starbuck is injured in battle, captured, and wakes up in a Cylon &quot;farm&quot; as part of their experiments to create human/Cylon hybrids. Without her knowledge, apparently one of her ovaries is surgically removed before she escapes; a fact discovered only much later. Starbuck escapes, and plans to return to the fleet; she promises to return to rescue the Caprican resistance group and Anders, with whom she has developed a romantic relationship.

Soon after returning from the planet Kobol, the Battlestar Pegasus, commanded by Rear Admiral Helena Cain, is discovered. Cain promotes Starbuck to Captain and assigns her as the CAG of the Pegasus.

After the fleet leadership denies her request to return to rescue the Caprican resistance fighters, Starbuck is depressed and guilt-stricken: she has broken her word, failed her duty, and assumes the man she is &quot;hung up on&quot; is either dead, or will be soon. As Pegasus CAG, she also feels responsible for the pilots who have died on her watch, or died because she has not yet killed the Cylon's &quot;top gun&quot;, &quot;Scar&quot;. She recklessly maneuvers to take out Scar, but at the last moment pulls away, setting up the kill for Louanne &quot;Kat&quot; Katraine and giving up her own status as &quot;Top Gun&quot;. Although this marks the beginning of a new resolve and the end of her self-destructive depressive behaviours, tensions between her and Apollo flare up again after she shoots him in a friendly fire incident during a hostage stand-off.

After Lee Adama's promotion to Commander and appointment as commander of the Battlestar Pegasus, Starbuck transfers back to the Galactica and assumes the role of its CAG.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;New Caprica

The complication of Starbuck and Lee's relationship was furthered when a drunken night on the newly found planet, New Caprica, ended with Starbuck and Lee having a one-night stand where they both expressed their love for one another. When Lee woke up alone the next morning, he soon discovered Kara had proposed to and married Anders. Lee soon marries newly commissioned Lieutenant Anastasia Dualla while Starbuck moves planetside with Anders.

After an all-night celebration of the first Founder's Day for New Caprica, tired and hungover, Starbuck and Tigh put their differences behind them. They even greet each other fondly following Tigh's demobilization and arrival at the colony. Her relationship with Lee, however, worsened to the point that they were not on speaking terms and he had little interest in helping her, even when Anders contracted a deadly pneumonia.

After the Cylon invasion of New Caprica, she is imprisoned inside a mental facility, designed to look like her own former Caprican apartment. While there, a Leoben model tries to convince her they are destined to be lovers. For four months Starbuck denies his advances, killing him several times despite knowing he would be back. Then she is presented with a young girl named Kacey that Leoben claims is their daughter, created with the ovary removed when she was in the egg farm. Initially she refuses to believe it and wants nothing to do with the girl, but when Kacey is badly injured in a fall down a staircase, she calls on Leoben for help and seems to grow more attached to both of them. During the uprising on New Caprica, however, Starbuck once again kills Leoben and escapes with Kacey.

In the episode &quot;Exodus&quot; Part II, it is revealed Kacey is not Starbuck's child; the Cylons had abducted her. Kacey and her real mother are reunited on the Galactica's flight deck after the flight from New Caprica. Starbuck is left there alone on the flight deck, stunned and in disbelief.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Back with the fleet

After her situation on New Caprica and the truth about Kacey, she is left simmering with rage, which causes her to be reckless and destructive, almost killing herself in a Viper training exercise. After being removed from flight status by then-Major Lee Adama, she takes up residence in the pilot's mess along with Colonel Tigh, drinking and lowering the morale of Galactica's pilots by attempting to draw divisions between New Capricans and those who stayed with the fleet. Rear Admiral Adama gives her an ultimatum; either straighten up and act like an officer, or 'get the hell off his ship' and find another ship to live on. Starbuck changes her attitude after Adama literally knocks her on her rear after she thumbs her nose at him.

Starbuck's relationship with Lee Adama takes another dramatic turn after she angrily challenges him to a brutal and emotional boxing match aboard Galactica. Their intense feelings for each other soon lead to an affair drawing resentment from their respective spouses. However, when Lee asks Starbuck to divorce Sam, she refuses due to her strong religious beliefs on the sacrament of marriage. Lee argues she is breaking her vows just by being with him, but Starbuck states she's merely bending the rules. Lee then decides he can no longer cheat while still married to Dualla. Later, Lee and Anders begin to voice their dislike for each other just as Starbuck's Raptor is shot down by the Cylons and she is reported missing. Anders vows to find her, but their position is outnumbered; Lee orders Anders at gunpoint to stay put and help defend their outnumbered position. Anders remains defiant.

Starbuck suffers severe hand burns in the crash and is rescued by Dualla. After they escape the doomed algae planet, Starbuck makes one final effort to have a relationship with Lee, this time offering to leave Anders if he will leave Dualla. Lee chooses to try to make his own marriage work instead.

Kara's experiences with Leoben, as well as her troubled childhood, eventually come back to haunt her. She has nightmares involving both Leoben and the mandala supposedly connected to her &quot;destiny&quot;. She asks an oracle about her dreams and is told Leoben understands her better than she understands herself, and he will show her &quot;destiny.&quot;

During a patrol over a gas giant where the fleet is refueling, she sees a Cylon Raider and pursues it into a storm system which resembles her mandala. She is forced to abandon pursuit when her Viper is at risk of implosion from the pressure. Although she felt several impacts during her pursuit, then-Chief Galen Tyrol finds no damage to her Viper and gun camera footage showed no evidence of any Raider, leading many to believe Kara had been hallucinating.

Adama is concerned Kara might have burned out, but he leaves the decision to ground her up to Apollo as CAG. Apollo decides to give her another chance, and offers to fly as her wingman on her next patrol. During the patrol, Starbuck sees another Raider and again pursues. Her Viper is hit by debris and she is knocked out. She experiences a conversation with an Avatar with the appearance of Leoben set in her apartment on Caprica. The avatar forces Kara to confront her past, the abuse she received from her mother and the guilt she feels for leaving her mother to die alone. The avatar comments Kara has been running from her past just as she has been running away from death for her entire life, and implies eventually she will have to confront her fears and her &quot;destiny&quot;. Moments before regaining consciousness in her Viper, Kara realizes the person she is speaking to is not the Cylon Leoben Conoy, and states, &quot;You're not Leoben.&quot; The avatar grins and replies, &quot;Never said I was.&quot; She awakens in her Viper cockpit as Apollo is calling for her to break off and ascend, or the atmospheric pressure will kill her. Starbuck keeps flying into the storm, and tells Lee to leave her. She is encompassed by a white light and certain calmness. Apollo witnesses her Viper exploding, with no sign that she survived.

In the cliffhanger Season 3 finale, &quot;Crossroads, Part II&quot;, Starbuck reappears in a Viper and is discovered by Apollo, appearing to be alive and well,[5] but the reason for her sudden resurrection has yet to be revealed. She tells Apollo not to &quot;freak out&quot; it is really her and she has been to Earth, and will show them the way.

Kara returns in Season 4 believing she had only been absent for six hours, but her husband Sam informs her she was really gone for two months. The crew is wary of her return except for Lee, who greets her with an enthusiastic and long hug, and is so grateful for her return he is willing to overlook the possibility she is a Cylon, and he may be willing to accept her even as a Cylon. This becomes evident in Lee's questioning of his father whether if it had been his son, Lee's brother, who returned, would it have made a difference whether he was Cylon or human. She experiences frustration upon her return to Galactica, as no one believes it is really her, and because of President Roslin's refusal to be guided by what she believes is a Cylon trick. The crew continues on the course Roslin had previously decided upon and move further away from the area Kara believes is Earth's true location. She attempts to encourage Adama to follow her suggestions, but when he refuses, she fears his being romantically linked to Roslin has unjustly influenced him. Feeling hopeless and fearing as they make more jumps farther away she will lose the &quot;feeling&quot; of Earth's location, she becomes desperate and holds President Roslin at gunpoint.

During her standoff with the President, she tries to reason and appeal to the President's emotions. She hands the gun to Roslin and insists she shoot her if she really believes she is a Cylon, to which Roslin responds to by saying &quot;They made you perfect, didn't they?&quot; Roslin fires the gun, but misses Starbuck and hits a framed portrait of herself and Adama.

Starbuck is thrown into the brig and has a hostile confrontation with Adama, who angrily says, &quot;You are so stupid you couldn't wait. You just lost your best ally. Now who is going to save you?&quot; She responds, &quot;Well, it certainly isn't you,&quot; and says she will fight to show them Earth's location until her death. She also accuses him of playing &quot;wet nurse&quot; to the president, to which he responds by throwing her to the floor and leaving her crying.

Later, after Adama attempts to have a conversation with Roslin, which turns into a psychological sparring argument, he rethinks his decision and allows Kara to secretly look for Earth on a barge called Demetrius.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Aboard Demetrius - Looking for Earth

After taking command of Demetrius to find a way to Earth, Thrace finds herself at odds with the crew when her orders cause them to doubt her command ability. With only two days remaining until the ship must return to the Fleet, her command is further compromised by her refusal to explain her actions and her decision to bring the Cylon Leoben aboard after having found him in a damaged Cylon Heavy raider. Eventually, she finds herself torn between following Leoben's advice to forge an alliance with the fragmented Cylons, or distrusting him because of what the risk entails. The tension with the crew leads to a mutiny, after which Kara acknowledges her errors and instead takes a small crew with her in a Raptor to visit the base ship. There, she meets with the base star's hybrid and is told, &quot;You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace. You will lead them all to their end.&quot;[6] This echoes the warning given by the first hybrid to Kendra Shaw at the conclusion of Razor.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Earth

In &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot;, Thrace and Leoben look for the Colonial beacon which led them to Earth. They find wreckage of a Viper with Thrace's tail number and what appears to be Thrace's charred corpse.[7] Both Kara and Leoben are shocked by this discovery and do not understand what it means. After removing the dog tags and wedding ring, Kara asks &quot;What does it mean? If that is me, then who am I?&quot;. He responds by backing away, as if recoiling from the realization that she is indeed the &quot;Harbinger of Death.&quot; She returns to the wrecked viper and, after carefully wrapping the remains in a parachute shawl, she incinerates the body on a funeral pyre.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Mutiny

In &quot;The Oath&quot;, Captain Thrace discovers civilians and a few mutinous Marines and crewmen arming themselves for battle. Thrace rushes back to her quarters to prepare for battle, grabbing her sidearms and ammunition. Kara then finds Lieutenant Margaret &quot;Racetrack&quot; Edmondson, Charlie Conner, and a few others preparing to execute Lee Adama. Thrace kills a Marine holding Adama and wounds Lieutenant Hamish &quot;Skulls&quot; McCall. Along with Lee Adama, Kara runs into several other loyal Colonials including President Roslin, Admiral Adama, and Colonel Tigh. While searching for Adama, Kara and Lee free loyalists found in the brig which includes Anders, who is then shot by a mutinous marine upon leaving. Kara, refusing to leave his side, pressures Lee and those who escaped to leave her in order for them to search for Adama.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;The song

In the episode &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot;, Starbuck encounters a pianist in Joe's Bar who is trying to compose a new song. At first she becomes annoyed by his repetitious playing, stating he reminds her of her father when he did nothing but play the piano and she mentions how her father left her and her mother to pursue it as a career. Over the course of the episode, Starbuck befriends the pianist and ends up working with him to try to finish his song.

Toward the end, the piano player writes down the notes Starbuck hums out on a sheet of paper. The pattern reminds Starbuck of a drawing of colored dots the Cylon-Human child, Hera Agathon had given to her earlier. She lines the child's drawing up with the notes the composer had drawn and they match exactly.

When Starbuck and the pianist play the notes, the song is instantly recognized by Saul Tigh and Tory Foster – who are sitting at a nearby table with Ellen Tigh – as the song (&quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;) they heard in their heads when they learned they were the final Cylons. Ellen, of course, remembers it from Earth. A bewildered Saul asks Starbuck where she heard the song. Starbuck responds she played it as a kid and begins to mention her father, but stops short when she realizes the piano player, her father, was either a figment of her imagination or a vision.

In the episode &quot;Daybreak, Part I&quot; Starbuck tries to get answers from Anders about the song, even turning notes into numbers to see if there is a mathematical solution.

In &quot;Daybreak, Part II and III&quot;, after getting the coordinates from Anders for the Cylon Colony, Starbuck joins in on the rescue mission for Hera. After saving Hera, and as the Colony is being destroyed, Starbuck is ordered by Admiral Adama to jump the Galactica away to safety. Although she has no coordinates, Adama tells her to make a blind jump to anywhere. Recalling the musical notes and the numbers she extrapolated from it, she inputs them into the computer; the resulting jump puts Galactica near a habitable planet the fleet decides to settle on. It is revealed this new planet is our world, some 150,000 years ago; Admiral Adama names it &quot;Earth&quot;, believing it better matched the dream the fleet had been seeking than did the original Earth (which had been found destroyed by nuclear war).

Once settled on the world, Kara says a final goodbye to Admiral Adama and tells Lee she's leaving - her 'job is done' - and will not be coming back. Kara then disappears into thin air and is not seen again. What really happened to Kara is left ambiguous. According to Katee Sackhoff, &quot;So when she at the end was saying goodbye to [Anders], I think that she was saying goodbye to their bodily forms,&quot; she said. &quot;I think she knew, especially if he says, 'I'll see you on the other side,' I think she's with him. I think they're both dead, but I think she's with him. That was a decision that we made, because I selfishly wanted her at peace, and the only way to do that was to have her with someone at the end, or to be with the person she wanted to be with. I don't know. That's kind of where I think she is. She's with Anders playing pyramid in the sky somewhere.&quot; [8]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">In the episode, Cylons capture Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace and hold her in an abandoned hospital, where they are performing experiments with human reproduction. Starbuck escapes and leaves Caprica to return to the human fleet. Commander William Adama returns to command of the fleet, but President Laura Roslin persuades almost a third of the fleet to follow her back to Kobol.

Plot&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Caprica

Starbuck wakes up with Sam Anders. He tries to persuade her to stay on Caprica, but she insists on returning to Galactica. She recommends the resistance give up fighting, move to higher ground, and wait for her to return with a rescue party.

Cylons ambush the resistance as they make plans to capture a Cylon Heavy Raider. Starbuck is shot and loses consciousness. She wakes in a hospital, where a doctor named Simon tends her. Simon explains that Anders brought her to the hospital but later died from a shrapnel wound. Simon laughingly dismisses Starbuck's suspicion that he is a Cylon and explains away her other concerns. He presses the idea that Starbuck have a baby, calling child-bearing women &quot;a very precious commodity to us.&quot; Starbuck demurs.

Meanwhile, Anders, very much alive, leads a search party. Caprica-Boomer appears and promises to take them to Starbuck.

Starbuck is kept heavily sedated. She is suspicious after an unplanned emergency surgery following a pelvic examination, and her suspicions are confirmed when Simon calls her &quot;Starbuck&quot;, a name she never revealed to him. Starbuck fakes sedation and sneaks out of her room, where she sees Simon talking to a Number Six copy. When Simon returns, Starbuck kills him by stabbing him with a fragment from a broken mirror. Searching for a way out, she discovers other captured human women, attached to machines. One woman, a member of the resistance, says they have become &quot;baby machines&quot; and &quot;can't live like this.&quot; Starbuck breaks the Cylon equipment, killing the women. Fleeing, she encounters another copy of Simon, confirming that he is a Cylon. The resistance rescues Starbuck with the aid of Boomer, who provides close air support from a Heavy Raider.

Boomer explains that the Cylons have had no success reproducing on their own and are trying to reproduce with humans. Appalled, Starbuck volunteers to stay and help liberate these so-called &quot;Farms&quot;. Anders reminds her of her mission, and she reiterates her promise to return with rescue. She departs in the stolen Heavy Raider to return to the human fleet.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;The human fleet

Commander Adama returns to command and orders a ship-by-ship search for Roslin and Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama, who are still on the run. After Apollo finds himself unable to go through with Tom Zarek's suggestion that he denounce his father publicly, Roslin sends a message to the fleet asking anyone who believes in the prophecies to follow her to Kobol. Commander Adama dismisses the message as &quot;religious crap&quot; and is astonished when almost a third of the fleet follows her.

Chief Galen Tyrol says Galactica-Boomer was just a machine, but Commander Adama insists she was more than that. Adama reminds Tyrol that the Cylons will resurrect Boomer and tells him Specialist Cally will spend 30 days in the brig for shooting her. Adama views Boomer's corpse in the morgue and weeps over her.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3027">In the episode, Starbuck returns to the human fleet bearing the Arrow of Apollo. President Laura Roslin leads a team to the surface of Kobol to find the Tomb of Athena and a map to Earth.[2] Commander William Adama overcomes his anger at Roslin and her allies and joins them on Kobol, where the Tomb provides a clue to Earth's location. The fleet is reunited.

Plot

In the previous episode, &quot;The Farm&quot;, Adama returned to command following an assassination attempt by the Galactica copy of Boomer (Galactica-Boomer). Roslin led almost a third of the fleet back to Kobol to search for a way to Earth. Starbuck left Caprica with Helo and the Cylon known until then as the Caprica copy of Boomer (Sharon).[3]&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Part 1

Roslin struggles to persuade the Quorum of Twelve of Apollo's loyalty. Tom Zarek suggests arming the civilian ships in case Galactica attacks, but Apollo says they would stand no chance against the battlestar. Priestess Elosha reminds everyone that the Scriptures predict that a return to Kobol would result in lives lost.

Starbuck docks with Roslin's flagship. Before she can explain about Caprica-Sharon, Apollo sees her and puts a gun to Caprica-Sharon's head. Helo appears and draws his weapon on Apollo to defend Sharon. Roslin defuses the standoff by promising Sharon will not be harmed but then orders her thrown out the airlock. Roslin only relents when Sharon claims to know the location of the Tomb of Athena, where the Scriptures claim a path to Earth can be found. Roslin threatens to put Helo and Sharon, and thus their unborn child, out the airlock unless Sharon leads them to it.

Privately, Zarek admits to his aide-de-camp, Meier, that he does not share Roslin's religious convictions. They plot to kill Apollo so Zarek can replace him at Roslin's side.

On Kobol, Roslin leads a team that includes Apollo, Starbuck, Sharon, Helo, Zarek, Meier, Elosha, and several guards. Elosha is killed by a land mine. Cylon Centurions ambush the party, who fends them off with the help of Sharon; she grabs a stray grenade launcher and destroys one of the Centurions, to Apollo's surprise.

On Galactica, Commander Adama assesses what resources remain after the defection of part of the fleet to &quot;a religious fanatic and a terrorist&quot;, as he describes Roslin and Zarek. He appoints George Birch, an inexperienced but &quot;honest and loyal&quot; pilot, to replace Apollo commanding the Viper pilots; several accidents happen under Birch's leadership. Adama appears before the press; denounces those who followed Roslin, whom he describes as no longer President; and threatens to detain anyone who reports that he does not know where Earth is. Later, he confides in Anastasia &quot;Dee&quot; Dualla how hurt he is by betrayal. Dee replies that he has broken his promise to find the fleet a new home and suggests his hurt has more to do with his own feeling of helplessness than betrayal. Adama dismisses Dee brusquely but later asks for reconnaissance photos of Kobol, promising to reunite the fleet, &quot;our family</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3214">Part 2

Head Six tells Gaius Baltar that their child will be born in the cell built for Galactica-Boomer. Baltar loses patience and starts mocking the idea that he could have a child with an imaginary woman. Six dons a casual appearance and tells Baltar that she is nothing more than a coping mechanism created by his subconscious following his participation in the genocide of humanity. She taunts him and encourages him to get a brain scan. Doctor Cottle finds nothing wrong and writes Baltar off as a hypochondriac.

Sharon continues to guide the party on Kobol based on her knowledge of (in-universe) human theology. Apollo remains suspicious of Sharon and Helo, but Starbuck vouches for them. Sharon tells Helo she has many memories as Boomer aboard Galactica and that their child will be female. Meier suggests to Zarek that they frame Sharon for Apollo's murder, but Zarek insists they wait until they've found the Tomb.

Commander Adama arrives on Kobol with Billy Keikeya and Chief Galen Tyrol. Roslin reconciles with Billy. Adama reconciles with Apollo and Starbuck. He attacks Sharon, recalling Galactica-Boomer's betrayal, but is prevented from killing her by chest pain following his surgery.[4] Adama reconciles with Roslin, acknowledges her role in saving his and Apollo's life following the Cylon attack on the Colonies, and joins her quest for the Tomb. Tyrol approaches Sharon uncomfortably; Sharon tells him she &quot;remembers&quot; him and hugs him.

Meier tells Sharon about the murder of Galactica-Boomer and warns her to start looking out for herself and her baby. After Adama arrives, Zarek orders Meier to stop plotting, to no avail. Sharon tells Helo she plans to &quot;take matters into my own hands.&quot; Meier provides her a handgun, and she promises to ambush Commander Adama when they reach the Tomb. However, when the time comes, she shoots Meier instead, declares she has no hidden programming like Galactica-Boomer's, and surrenders the weapon to Adama.

Adama orders Tyrol to guard Zarek, Sharon, and Helo and enters the Tomb with Roslin, Apollo, Starbuck, and Billy. Starbuck inserts the Arrow of Apollo into a statue of the archer Sagittaron, triggering a vision of a grassy field under a night sky. The party sees constellations representing each of the Twelve Colonies, and Starbuck realizes they are &quot;standing&quot; on Earth. Apollo recognizes a nebula among the constellations (he says it's the Lagoon Nebula, to which his father Adama says it's Astral Body M8) and concludes the fleet can plot its next direction based on it.

Returning to Galactica, Adama promises to keep the fleet unified and reinstates Roslin as President. Sharon is placed in a cell built for Galactica-Boomer. Helo speaks to Sharon about their baby through a direct phone line. Eavesdropping, Baltar realizes the connection with Six's prediction for their &quot;child&quot;. Having ruled out the possibility that Six is created by a chip in his brain, and now concluding from her foreknowledge of Sharon's pregnancy that she cannot just be his own creation, he asks what she is. She answers, &quot;I'm an angel of God sent here to protect you, to guide you, to love you.&quot; He asks, &quot;To what end?&quot; She replies, &quot;The end of the human race.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2379">Plot

In &quot;[[Valley of Darkness]]&quot;, a computer virus created by the Cylons shut down Galactica's power, but Lieutenant Felix Gaeta seemingly purged it.[1] In &quot;[[The Farm]]&quot;, Commander William Adama sentenced Specialist Cally to 30 days in Galactica's brig for killing the Number Eight copy who shot Adama (Boomer).[2]

Gaeta determines that the Cylon virus is still active, is responsible for a series of malfunctions aboard Galactica, and threatens to take full control of the ship. Adama enlists Sharon's help. She confirms Gaeta's diagnosis and warns that a Cylon attack is imminent. Hundreds of Cylon Raiders and Heavy Raiders appear and hold formation, preparing to activate the virus. Forced to trust Sharon, Adama allows her to interface directly with Galactica's systems by inserting a fiber optic cable into her hand. Sharon helps delete the virus and broadcasts a virus of her own to the Cylon ships, rendering them helpless and easy pickings for the Vipers. Sharon is summarily returned to her cell.

Helo is ostracized by his crewmates for his relationship with Sharon. Haunted by memories of Boomer, Tyrol does not join the celebration of Cally's release. Tyrol and Helo argue about their respective relationships with Number Eight; the argument comes to blows. Inspired by Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama's comment that &quot;no one's expecting any miracles&quot;, Tyrol begins to build a new starfighter from salvaged parts.

[[Baah Pakal]] A freighter among the fleet that had a pair of outdated DDG-62 engines that Chief Tyrol acquired to power his Blackbird stealth fighter in &quot;[[Flight of the Phoenix]] &quot;.Despite initial skepticism, crew members from throughout the ship join the project. At Helo's suggestion, Tyrol uses carbon composites for the exterior, making it stealth capable. The completed fighter, known as the [[Blackbird]], makes a successful maiden flight with Starbuck as test pilot.

At the Blackbird's dedication ceremony, President Laura Roslin, who has just learned she has weeks to live, praises the fighter's construction as &quot;an act of faith.&quot; Tyrol reveals that the fighter is named Laura in her honor. Helo reconciles with his crewmates, and Tyrol visits Sharon in her cell.In the episode, the Number Eight copy being held on Galactica (Sharon) helps delete a computer virus created by the Cylons, and Chief Galen Tyrol builds a stealth fighter from spare parts.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2253">In the episode, President Laura Roslin orders Sharon's pregnancy terminated. The order is suspended after Gaius Baltar discovers that the fetus's blood can cure Roslin's cancer, which it does. Baltar aligns himself with an underground group of Cylon sympathizers whose ranks include the troubled [[Number Six]] copy Gina.



Plot

Roslin lies near death in Galactica's sickbay. Doctor Cottle reports abnormalities in Sharon's unborn child's blood. Believing the child a threat to the fleet, Roslin orders her pregnancy terminated over Baltar's objections. Head Six, who regards Sharon's child as hers with Baltar,[1] appears to Baltar and insists he intervene. Roslin's decision outrages Sharon and Helo, the child's father, who obstructs the entrance to sickbay. Baltar defuses the standoff by announcing that a transfusion of the fetus's abnormal blood may save Roslin's life. The procedure cures Roslin's cancer within days.

In a sequence of delirious flashbacks, Roslin recalls negotiating an end to a teachers' strike on Caprica as Secretary of Education. Her conciliatory approach angered then-President Richard Adar, with whom she was having an affair, but she refused to back down. She also recalls seeing Baltar with a Number Six shortly before the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies.

A civilian crew member sabotages some ammunition. An investigation reveals she is a member of Demand Peace, an underground group of Cylon sympathizers. Admiral William Adama feigns negotiation with Demand Peace only to arrest its representative, Royan Jahee, when he arrives on Galactica. Demand Peace bombs a fuel refinery ship. Roslin meets with Jahee, agrees to hear his group's case, and warns that further violence will lead to harsh measures.

Baltar meets secretly with Gina on Cloud Nine. Gina rejects his sexual advances but invites him to join Demand Peace; Baltar refuses. Head Six laments that saving Roslin's life prevented Baltar, who is Vice President, from becoming President. Baltar concludes from a letter Roslin wrote to him in the event of her death that she will never trust him. Jahee returns to Cloud Nine and presents Gina with a gift from Baltar: a nuclear warhead Adama provided Baltar for research purposes in an earlier episode.</text>

Haunted by his near-death experience after ejecting from the Blackbird, Apollo begins sleeping with Shevon, a prostitute on Cloud Nine who reminds him of his pregnant[1] girlfriend who died in the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies. Dee asks Apollo whether their relationship is going anywhere; he brushes her off.

[[Prometheus]] is a cargo vessel,President Laura Roslin decides to crack down on the black market within the fleet. Commander Jack Fisk at first advises against it but then volunteers Pegasus to take the lead. Fisk is later found strangled to death with piano wire in his quarters. Assigned to investigate the murder, Apollo discovers Fisk was heavily involved in the black market, and that Vice President Gaius Baltar and Colonel Saul Tigh were among Fisk's trading partners. Roslin privately asks Baltar to resign; the suggestion insults Baltar and redoubles his determination to stay in office.

Responding to an emergency call from Shevon, Apollo rushes to Cloud Nine to find her bruised and distressed. Thugs enter Shevon's room and attack Apollo. As he is being strangled with piano wire, a gangster tells Apollo to stop investigating Fisk's murder, threatens Shevon and her daughter Paya if he refuses, and knocks Apollo out. Apollo wakes to find Shevon and Paya gone and the wielder of the piano wire murdered.

Tom Zarek enters the room soon after. He claims he refused to join Fisk's smuggling network and suggests that the murderer's corpse was given to Apollo as &quot;a way out&quot; of his investigation. Apollo is not dissuaded, so Zarek mentions a man named Phelan who runs the black market. On Phelan's ship, Apollo discovers the black market is hoarding antibiotics and trafficking in children; Paya is among their prisoners. Phelan, who turns out to be the gangster from before, reveals that Shevon works for him and defends the black market as necessary. Apollo offers Phelan amnesty if he will release Shevon and Paya and shut down his operation. When Phelan refuses, Apollo wrests a bodyguard's handgun and kills Phelan. Apollo warns the other smugglers to clean up their operation.

Roslin objects but acquiesces to the resolution. Zarek makes his way aboard Phelan's ship. Shevon refuses to see Apollo again, saying she cannot replace his lost love. Dee returns to Billy Keikeya</text>

Drunk in the pilots' mess, Starbuck vows to destroy Scar, a Raider known as the Cylons' ace of aces and dreaded for his sneak attacks. Kat challenges Starbuck, getting her to bet her beer stein labeled &quot;Galactica Top Gun&quot;. Later, Kat interrupts Starbuck during a briefing, breaks her record in a test of shooting a side arm accurately while dizzy, and chastises her after her advice gets a rookie pilot killed by Scar.

Sharon warns Starbuck that Scar is likely so competent and bloodthirsty because &quot;he&quot; has died and been resurrected many times. With the Cylon Resurrection ship gone, destroying him would make his death permanent.

Starbuck is troubled by memories of Anders, whom she promised to rescue from Caprica; Admiral William Adama and President Laura Roslin have refused to order a rescue mission. After the rookie's death, she drunkenly comes on to Apollo but rejects him during foreplay. They fight over her feelings for Anders. She leaves and continues drinking while watching archival footage of Scar.

Later, Starbuck is hung over and assigns another pilot to take her place on patrol. When Scar kills her inexperienced wingman, Kat blames Starbuck. They trade insults. Starbuck taunts Kat for her fear of Scar, and Kat punches Starbuck. Apollo arrives, cutting the altercation short. He orders the two pilots to fly together to protect a mining operation in an asteroid field.

As Starbuck and Kat patrol in their Vipers, Kat pursues a Raider she believes to be Scar. As Starbuck checks behind them, the real Scar appears and damages Starbuck's Viper. Starbuck plays chicken with Scar, to Kat's horror. Remembering her promise to Anders, Starbuck swerves at the last moment. She lures Scar into Kat's line of fire, and Kat shoots him down. Back in the mess, Starbuck yields her stein to Kat and toasts a succession of pilots who have perished since the war began. She claimed previously that she could not remember their names.In the episode, Viper pilots Starbuck and Kat form a rivalry over which of them will destroy Scar, a feared Cylon Raider. Tormented by her feelings for Sam Anders, Starbuck nearly allows Scar to kill her in a game of chicken. In the end, she swerves and lures Scar to Kat, who destroys Scar</text>

Apollo, freshly promoted to Major, is assigned to the Battlestar Pegasus to assist her new captain, Commander Barry Garner, the ship's former senior engineer. When two Pegasus Raptors sent out on a routine training mission by Captain Starbuck disappear from DRADIS, Commander Garner places all blame on Starbuck, implying that she is negligent.

On Galactica, a pregnant teen stowaway is discovered who seeks an abortion by Dr. Cottle. She requests political asylum while her Geminese family demands that she be returned to them. When the issue is brought to President Roslin, she initially embraces the legality of abortion prior to the Cylon attack, but is pressured by the representative of Gemenon - an important constituency for Roslin's run for reelection. When discussing this with Admiral Adama, he points out the need of babies for the survival of the human race. Vice President Baltar provides a calculation that at the current rate humanity will become extinct in 18 years.

On Pegasus, Starbuck concludes that the missing raptors may have jumped away to answer a phony distress call, a common Cylon tactic. In light of the danger, Admiral Adama orders a cautious recon mission to find the missing ships. Commander Garner, discounting Starbuck's theory, jumps the Pegasus to the location where they find the missing crews dead and are attacked by three Cylon Basestars. With the FTL drive damaged, Garner places Apollo in command of the ship and rushes to repair the FTL drive.

Apollo is able to fend off the attacking Basestars and buy time for Garner's engineering. Garner succeeds in repairing the FTL drive but dies in the process. Apollo jumps the Pegasus back to safety and is rewarded by his father by being promoted and appointed Commander of the Pegasus.

Back on Galactica, President Roslin issues an executive decree banning abortion but not before allowing the Gemenese girl to terminate her pregnancy and granting her asylum, thereby infuriating the Gemenese representative. During a press conference, Vice President Baltar publicly denounces Roslin's decision and announces his candidacy in the upcoming elections</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2567">Plot

In the absence of Gaius Baltar, Tom Zarek has become President of the Colonies. Knowing that the military will never support him as President, he agrees to stand down in favor of Laura Roslin. He will re-convene the Quorum of Twelve, nominate Roslin as Vice President, and then resign once she is confirmed. He asks Roslin if he can still play some part in the new government, to which Roslin offers him the Vice-Presidency.

Zarek secretly authorizes a group called &quot;The Circle&quot;, consisting of Colonel Tigh, Chief Tyrol, Samuel Anders, and three others to judge and execute those whom they unanimously find to have collaborated with the Cylons during their occupation of New Caprica. There is no formal trial; instead, the Circle reviews the available evidence, votes, and then offers the convicted a chance to plead their case. At least thirteen people are executed, including flight deck specialist James &quot;Jammer&quot; Lyman.

Felix Gaeta is brought to the Galactica CIC to repair its communications system and is verbally abused by Tigh for being a collaborator. Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace later criticizes Gaeta over lunch. He claims to have explained repeatedly that he was funneling information to the resistance, but no one believes him. Starbuck appears traumatized by her long captivity with the Cylons, causing further rifts in her marriage to Anders.

The Circle begins to discuss Gaeta's possible execution, but Anders quits during the deliberation, not wanting to continue to judge any more cases. Tigh replaces Anders with Starbuck, who votes for Gaeta's execution. Tigh and three others vote along with Starbuck and then eventually convince Tyrol to vote with them. The Circle then abducts Gaeta and prepares to execute him. An angry Starbuck demands that he beg for his life and attacks him, reminding him of what he told her in the mess hall, including the dog bowl dead drop. Chief Tyrol realizes that Gaeta had been the resistance's source and sets him free.

Roslin and Admiral Adama finally learn of The Circle. Zarek tells Roslin that any public trials would only lead to unacceptable infighting within the fleet. After Roslin takes her presidential oath of office, she announces a general pardon and announces the formation of a truth commission to reconcile the fleet.

Meanwhile, Baltar is held prisoner on a [[Cylon Basestar]]; the Cylons are debating whether they should have brought along a human. Of the seven models taking part in the decision, the issue is deadlocked three for and three against. The final decision rests with Number Six.</text>

The Basestar, or Baseship is the primary capital ship of the Cylons within the re-imagining of the science fiction mini-series and television series Battlestar Galactica. They are different in appearance and function from the Basestars of the 1978 TV series.

Earlier Basestars have a design similar to that of the 1978 series. The following deals with Basestars as they existed during the main events of the series.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;General description

Basestars physically resemble two Y-shaped sections joined at an axis and pointing in opposite directions, although those sections can swivel to direct alignment for atmospheric flight.[3] They are designed to make FTL jumps and are equipped to deploy large-scale strikes with nuclear and conventional ordnance. Basestars are biomechanical entities, with fleshy &quot;hangars&quot; to house Raiders. Basestars are capable of carrying other Cylon models as crew within them.[4]

A tactical nuclear weapon was deployed aboard a base star in orbit over Kobol and the base star was destroyed in the resulting explosion. In the season two episode &quot;Resurrection Ship, Part II&quot;, with both sides' fighter groups engaged elsewhere the Battlestars Galactica and Pegasus engage and destroy one Basestar in ship-to-ship combat. The second Basestar is not seen to explode however it takes massive damage. Robbed of their Raider fleet (which is superior in numbers to a Battlestar's Viper complement), they appear to be no match for the Battlestars. The Battlestars used the tactic of circling one Basestar while firing upon it until destroyed.[5] A similar tactic is used in the battle of New Caprica in which the Galactica uses diversions to occupy the Cylon Raiders and fights four Basestars simultaneously. With the arrival of the Pegasus, two Basestars are lost - one by crashing Pegasus into it, a second due to collateral damage from the resulting explosion and debris. A third Basestar is heavily damaged by direct fire from the Pegasus' forward main batteries.[6] Another basestar was seen to explode after its crew died from a virus contacted from a recovered artifact that is presumed to have been left behind by the 13th tribe.

The role and performance of the basestars indicate that they are not nearly as well armored or armed as battlestars. Although they possess formidable missile-based offensive weaponry, their defensive capabilities appear limited entirely to their Raiders. Basestars appear to have no kinetic-energy weapons equivalent to those found on Colonial warships. Deprived of their Raiders, basestars are extremely vulnerable to Colonial warships. In contrast, while the Galactica is heavily dependent on its Vipers for defense, it is heavily armored against nuclear and conventional weapons and has several batteries capable of maintaining a much higher volume of fire than a basestar can achieve.

Later episodes establish a basestar's ability to &quot;heal&quot; itself of battle damage. In &quot;Guess What's Coming to Dinner&quot; a severely damaged basestar regenerates its damaged and truncated &quot;spokes&quot; over the course of the episode. It appears nearly fully repaired by the end of the episode. It is not known how the basestar performs this feat without raw materials. It is not known if basestars can regenerate their Raider complements. By Blood on the Scales it is still not fully repaired and bears damage with at least one of its spikes not fully regrown. Despite the damage it took it shows a remarkable tenacity and is able to engage in a major battle not long after its repairs started.

In the add-on to the series, &quot;The Plan&quot;, a basestar was shown entering and flying through the upper atmosphere of a colonial planet similar to earth, after rotating it is upper and lower halves into alignment, giving it an apparent &quot;front end&quot; and &quot;swept back wings&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;The Hybrid

The Basestar's internal functions are controlled by a part-biological, part-machine central computer system known as the Hybrid. The biological part of the Hybrid is a female humanoid Cylon-like being (played by Tiffany Lyndall-Knight), housed inside an immersion tank similar to a Cylon re-birthing tank and attached to the mechanical part of the Basestar computers by umbilicals.[7] The Hybrids do not have a completely human body, but rather appear to be more like cyborgs, consisting of conduits and other connectors mated to, or in place of elements of their bodies. The Hybrid is not one of the &quot;twelve models&quot; of humanoid Cylon, but is a separate model that is essentially another stage in &quot;evolution&quot; from fully mechanical Centurion, to partially biomechanical Raider, to humanoid Cylon. Hybrids are similar to the autonomous biomechanical pilots within Raiders, specially constructed as living computers that manage the autonomic functions of the Basestar, including navigation and FTL jumps, climate control, and the like. The extent to which a given Hybrid is integrated into its Basestar means that, for all practical purposes, they are the Basestar.

The Hybrid is revealed to be capable of having its own opinions and thoughts, but does not have a say in decisions made by the humanoid Cylon models. The humanoid Cylon models control the Basestar via &quot;control panels&quot; in the Basestar's Control Room that are made up of a red flowing substance that seems to take the commands to the Hybrid itself.[7]

The Hybrid speaks strange, seemingly random phrases, which most Cylons interpret as the nonsensical babbling of a deranged mind. However, the Leoben Conoy model of Cylons believe that every word the Hybrid speaks means something, and that the Cylon god speaks through the Hybrids. The Caprica Model Six Cylon, however, has given an alternate explanation: the Hybrids do not perceive their existence in the same way as normal beings. They possess an expanded awareness of being one entity existing in space as well as perceiving all activity in their basestar's interior.[7] The Hybrid may also express the state of the ship physically, as demonstrated when one has a physical reaction during an FTL jump, similar to an orgasm.[7]“ Two protons expelled at each coupling site creates the mode of force the embryo becomes a fish that we don't enter until A-plate we're here to experience evolve the little toe atrophy don't ask me how I'll be dead in a thousand light years thank you thank you Genesis turns to its source reduction occurs stepwise though the essence is all one end of line. FTL system check diagnostic functions within parameters repeats the harlequin the agony exquisite the colors run the path of ashes fifty-two percent of heat exchanger cross-collateralized with hyper-dimensional matrix upper senses repair ordered relay to zero, zero, zero, zero. — Hybrid (Torn) ”


The Centurions developed the Hybrids on their own while attempting to evolve, but nothing that could live independently. They agreed to cease the war with humanity in exchange for the Final Five building them fully humanoid Cylons with the ability to resurrect.[8]

After being shot in the back of the head, Samuel Anders is hooked up to Galactica's main power grid in an effort to reset his neural net- after which, he essentially takes on the role of the ship's Hybrid. He speaks like a Hybrid and acts like one as well and his job as Galactica's Hybrid proves to be critical as he is able to access The Colony's Hybrids in the final battle and shut them down.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;The First Hybrid

The First Hybrid, an old Hybrid which first appeared in Battlestar Galactica: Razor, was played by Campbell Lane. Lieutenant William Adama witnessed him being &quot;created&quot; in grotesque biological experiments carried out on live human beings before the destruction of the Twelve Colonies. The First Hybrid was protected by a sect of old Cylon Centurions called the &quot;Guardians&quot;. The Guardians took off with him in a prototype basestar just before the Armistice was signed and got away with him. He claimed to have the gift of prophecy and is far more lucid than newer models.

There are references in the Cylon databases to this prototype, considered a failed experiment and unaccounted for.

He is housed on a Cylon basestar known as the Guardian Basestar that is a cross between the old model Cylon basestar from the first Cylon war and the modern basestar. However, his basestar does not appear to possess any actual weapons of its own as it does not directly engage the Pegasus and relies on its own Raiders to do the battling for it.

After the First Hybrid's crew kidnapped a science team and his Raiders engaged the Pegasus, the remnants of humanity learned of his existence from Sharon Valerii, a cooperative Cylon prisoner who informed them of the legend surrounding his existence after seeing a crashed Raider on the Pegasus deck. After figuring out where the First Hybrid and his crew were, William Adama, now an Admiral and in charge of what was left of the human military, committed the battlestar Pegasus (last remaining battlestar besides the battlestar Galactica) to a rescue mission of the science team and the elimination of the First Hybrid. The Pegasus, under the command Lee Adama and accompanied by Admiral William Adama (who came along in order to get some answers and closure on what he witnessed so many years before), engaged the Guardian Basestar while a rescue team, led by Major Shaw and Captain Thrace, entered the basestar with a nuke. The science team was rescued, but the mortally wounded Shaw stayed behind to detonate the nuke. Shaw encountered the First Hybrid and he offered her forgiveness for her terrible actions and warned her about Starbuck being the Harbinger of Death. Shaw tried and failed to warn Pegasus of this information and detonated her nuke, killing herself and the First Hybrid, and destroying the Guardian Basestar. The First Hybrid expressed no fear at his death saying he will be reborn in ways uncertain.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2113">&quot;Torn&quot; is the sixth episode of the third season from the science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica. This episode introduces the concept of a &quot;hybrid&quot;, a semi-organic computer which operates the Basestar and is - in a 'very real sense' - to &quot;be&quot; the Basestar. Some Cylon models - the number twos (of which Leoben Conoy is), believe the Hybrid to be speaking for the one true god.

Plot&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Galactica

After Starbuck crashes her Viper during a training exercise, Apollo strips her flight status. Colonel Saul Tigh mourns for his wife. He and Starbuck criticize the crew members who spent the occupation of New Caprica with the fleet until a disgusted Admiral William Adama orders them to stop. Starbuck cuts her hair and seeks out Kacey, whom she brushed off earlier. Tigh confines himself to his quarters and drinks heavily.

Lieutenant Felix Gaeta reconstructs Gaius Baltar's work on the location of Earth[1] and determines the fleet should navigate to a distant nebula shaped like a lion's head (Lion's Head Nebula). The pilots choose &quot;Athena&quot; as the new call sign for Sharon Agathon after she explains that &quot;Boomer&quot; refers to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;The Cylon fleet

Caprica Six and a Number Three copy tell Baltar that the Cylons plan to make Earth their new home. Hoping the Cylons will let him live, Baltar tells them about the Lion's Head Nebula.

The Cylons send a basestar to scout the nebula but lose contact after a virus infects the ship and its crew. At Head Six's suggestion, Baltar volunteers to board the basestar so the Cylons can avoid exposure to the disease. A dying Six copy identifies an ancient beacon the crew found and brought aboard as the source of the sickness. She accuses Baltar of leading them to the nebula so they would find the infected beacon; Baltar kills her after she threatens to tell the others. Baltar omits mention of the beacon in his final report, but Caprica Six notices it in the photos he brought back.

The Cylons abandon the infected basestar. Later, Athena and Racetrack discover the basestar while scouting the nebula in a Raptor.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6446">Survivor Count: 41,420.

The fleet has found a Cylon Basestar adrift in space and the Galactica sends a wing of Raptors and Vipers to investigate. Major Apollo leads a boarding team inside the ship finding most of the Cylons are dead, however a small group is found barely alive on the bridge. The landing team also finds the mysterious cylinder device. Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon tries to access the Basestar's computer system to no avail. She then speaks with a Cylon copy of herself who calls her a traitor. Apollo requests permission to finish off the Cylons. However, at Captain Helo's suggestion, Admiral Adama orders the prisoners to be brought back to Galactica for interrogation. As the boarding party leaves the Basestar, it explodes, presumably by means of an auto-destruct mechanism. The strange device is destroyed with it.

Back at the Cylon fleet, Gaius Baltar is confronted by Number Three and Number Six, who ask why he didn't reveal the existence of the device he found on the Basestar. Baltar feigns ignorance at first, but then confesses that he did know about the device, and apologizes for not mentioning it sooner. Three and Six believe that he knows more about the device than he's letting on. They have two Centurions take him away for interrogation.

On Galactica, the Cylon prisoners, as well as Apollo's boarding party are placed under quarantine by Doctor Cottle. Later, he determines the virus to be a strain of Lymphocytic Encephalitis, one that has caused the Cylon's brains to swell and other symptoms like high fever, stupor and disorientation. Humans, however, are immune to it, so Cottle releases the pilots from quarantine but tells Athena to remain.

Cottle reports to Adama and President Roslin that he can create a serum that will suppress the virus and keep the Cylons alive, without ever curing them; the Cylons will have to be given periodic injections to keep them alive. A Cylon copy of Simon is brought before Adama and Roslin. In exchange for the serum, Simon explains the Cylons' plans to find Earth. He reveals that Baltar is with the Cylon fleet and is showing them the way to Earth. Simon further explains about the probe, and how the contaminated Basestar was abandoned by the rest of the Cylon fleet.

Apollo realizes that the human race now has a way to exterminate the Cylons once and for all. All they need do is execute their Cylon prisoners within range of a Cylon Resurrection Ship. The virus will download to that ship, and thereby spread to the rest of the Cylons race. Captain Helo objects to this plan, arguing that exterminating an entire race would be a &quot;crime against humanity&quot; and make the humans no better than the Cylons. Apollo argues that the Cylons are not human and they should be wiped out. Helo retorts saying that Sharon (&quot;Athena&quot;), his wife and a Galactica officer, has proved her loyalty, risking her neck time and again to help the human survivors and believes there may be more Cylons that think as she does.

Back at the Cylon fleet, Gaius is subjected to torture by Number Three. Baltar's mind wanders to a scene where he lies on a serene beach with Head Six. Fighting back waves of pain, Gaius tells Six that he knows nothing of the viral device's origin, but Six tells him to only think of her and to let his intelligence come up with the answers that Three wants to hear.

Elsewhere, Cottle releases Sharon from quarantine - her body contains cells from having carried a half-human baby (Hera), giving her immunity. Helo tells Athena of Apollo's plan to exterminate the Cylons with the virus and how it is eating away at his soul. Sharon asks if even a human would be able to keep her word (having been sworn in as a Galactica officer) when her entire race is about to be wiped out.

Adama meets with Roslin on Colonial One to discuss the proposal to wipe out the Cylons. Roslin is in favor of the plan, but Adama is uneasy, pointing out that he needs a Presidential Order to use biological weapons. Roslin sees through this as Adama's way of &quot;passing the buck&quot;, a point that Adama readily concedes. Roslin takes the responsibility, and orders Adama to carry out the plan to destroy the Cylons with the virus.

Back on the Basestar, Baltar continues to be tortured by Number Three who demands he tell her what he knows. Gaius's mind however drifts in and out between the torture room and the beach with Six, who begins to make love to him. In between intense pain and erotic pleasure, Baltar talks of religion and faith, a monologue that makes little sense to Three because Gaius is actually talking to the Six in his head. He tells Six he loves her but Three doesn't realize who he is talking to, and she ends the torture with a look of pity on her face.

Galactica jumps away from the Colonial fleet and appears in a location within the Cylons' detection range. A Cylon fleet, complete with Resurrection Ship, duly appears. Adama orders Apollo to execute the Cylon prisoners, but when Apollo arrives at their cell, he discovers that the Cylons are already dead. Adama immediately recalls the Galactica's fighters and the Galactica jumps away.

The Cylons were in fact killed by Helo, who had secretly sabotaged the air handlers to remove the oxygen from their cell. Expecting to be arrested at any moment, Helo confesses his actions to Athena. He tells Athena that he believes he has made the right decision. However, the dreaded knock at the door of his quarters never comes.

Adama tells Roslin that the Cylons were killed before they had a chance to download to the Resurrection Ship, and that the plan to infect the Cylons with the virus has failed. Roslin believes there are only two possible suspects and asks what Adama is going to do about an investigation. Adama refuses to pursue the investigation any further, however, and tells her that he considers the matter closed. Their discussion switches to the mysterious probe. Adama says that Doctor Cottle believes that the contamination of the beacon was probably unintentional (in real life, LCM virus is fairly common), and that the virus from the beacon is a strain that existed 3000 years ago — around the same time that the Scriptures say the Thirteenth Colony left Kobol. Adama believes the device was a marker, and that they are definitely on the right track to finding Earth. Roslin agrees with this, but points out that if the humans are on the right track to Earth, then the Cylons must be too</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6798">Plot

The fleet encounters two Cylon Raiders in pursuit of a third. Starbuck and Kat take out the two pursuing Raiders and engage the third when a panicked male voice comes over the comm identifying himself as Lt. Daniel &quot;Bulldog&quot; Novacek and pleads to call off the attack. Admiral Adama allows the Raider to land on the Galactica and a disheveled man emerges from the cockpit. Adama welcomes the man aboard apparently knowing who he is. Novacek is checked over by Doctor Cottle who confirms he is not a Cylon and in good physical health.

Novacek is then debriefed by Adama who is curious to know how he escaped the Cylons. Novacek explains that he was held prisoner for the past three years and found an opportunity for escape when the Cylons showed signs of sickness. Adama believes it was the effect of the virus they found killing the Cylons earlier, to which Novacek says he was apparently immune.

President Roslin asks for more details on Novacek's situation. Adama informs her that Novacek was a pilot for a black op mission when Adama was in command of the Battlestar Valkyrie. Adama was sent to the Tauron colony who were violating the Cylon Peace Treaty by mining tylium on a planet that was too close to the Armistice Line. Novacek was on a recon mission but the Cylons shot him down, and Adama states he didn't know that Novacek had survived.

Elsewhere, the Cylon Number Three is wandering the corridors of Galactica dodging security personnel. Once it becomes apparent they are after her, she runs away, coming upon a door she cannot open which reads &quot;End of Line&quot;. She turns to the human soldiers, telling them to shoot her. They do, but she quickly awakens from the &quot;dream&quot;, back aboard a Cylon Basestar and in bed after an apparent ménage à trois with Gaius Baltar and Number Six.

Back at the fleet, Adama goes to Colonel Tigh's quarters to tell him about the reappearance of Novacek. Tigh is baffled as to how the man had survived his recon mission and wonders what Adama plans to do about it, since Novacek's return could cause a problem if the &quot;truth&quot; were found out.

Later, Adama meets with his son Lee to discuss Novacek. Adama tells Lee the truth about the Tauron mission. Adama was ordered by the Colonial Admiralty (directly by Admiral Corman) to conduct surveillance on the Cylons. They hoped to send a stealth ship across the Armistice Line to learn about the Cylons' military capabilities and intentions. During the mission, unidentified Cylon ships, disabled Novacek's Stealthstar fighter. Lee is shocked to learn that some in the military suspected that the Cylons were using the Armistice to rebuild their forces and that an attack on the Colonies was inevitable. Adama then chokes up, stating the worst part of the mission was his decision to shoot down Novacek himself to avoid his being captured. He feared that if the Cylons captured him, they would retaliate knowing the humans violated the Armistice first by spying on them.

Simultaneously, Novacek visits Tigh. Believing Novacek already knew what really happened, Tigh reminisces about the fateful mission, revealing the harrowing truth about Adama's decision.

Adama continues with the story, lamenting that the failed mission probably instigated the Cylon attack. Despite protests from Lee, Adama believes that he is responsible for the destruction of the Colonies.

Back on the Basestar, Number Three's dreams grow increasingly worse and she seeks release. She orders a Centurion to kill her, overriding its directives and telling it to delete the incident from its memory afterwards. The Centurion promptly shoots her in the head and she is resurrected. After awakening from her &quot;death&quot;, she tells another Three that during her download, she saw &quot;something so beautiful between life and death&quot;, apparently getting a rush from the effect to temporarily escape her mental torment.

Back aboard Galactica, Starbuck analyzes the gun camera footage of the Cylon Raider chase of Novacek and finds something curious. She brings hard copies of the images to Tigh and informs him that the Raiders had every opportunity to shoot Novacek down, but it looks like they were purposely missing. She is also skeptical about Novacek not only escaping the Cylons, but how he managed to find the fleet as well. Tigh becomes concerned and goes to inform Adama.

Adama is in his quarters when he gets an urgent call from Novacek asking to talk to him. Adama quickly heads down and enters Novacek's quarters, where Novacek strikes him in the stomach with a metal pipe. Adama stoops over and Novacek hits him in the face, sending Adama crashing into a table. Novacek ties Adama up and begins choking him, furiously blaming his former commander for sending him on a mission to be captured and tortured by the Cylons for the past three years.

Tigh comes to Adama's rescue, pointing a gun to Novacek's head. Novacek goes for the gun, but Tigh fights him off with the metal pipe. Tigh defends the Admiral's decision to shoot Novacek down, telling him &quot;We're all soldiers Danny, we're all expendable.&quot; Tigh tells Novacek that he was duped by the Cylons. They purposely let him go and drove him toward the fleet, somehow knowing that once he learned the truth, he would try to kill Adama. Novacek finally comes to his senses and realizes he was just doing the Cylons' dirty work for them.

A while later, Adama goes to Colonial One and hands his resignation to Roslin, saying he has to face up to what he has done and no longer deserves his command. Roslin refuses his resignation; in fact, she was just about to award him a medal of distinction for his 45 years of military service. Adama says he doesn't deserve it, but she admits the medal is not for &quot;him&quot; but for &quot;them&quot;, the men and women under his command, who need a hero. When Adama laments his role in destroying the human race, Roslin responds by saying that the matter was both anybody's and everybody's fault. She also suggests he may have been manipulated by the admiralty to provoke a war. His penance in the Novacek matter will be to accept the medal, like it or not, and continue his job.

Adama accepts his medal. After the ceremony, he sees Novacek off as he departs for another ship in the fleet to attempt to rebuild his life as a civilian. Before he departs, Adama hands Novacek his Fleet uniform, reminding him &quot;once a pilot, always a pilot,&quot; and the two salute each other one final time. Adama is then later paid a visit in his quarters by Colonel Tigh, who is uncertain why he went there in the first place. When Tigh rebuffs Adama's plea for him to return to his duties as the Galactica's XO, Adama then asks him if he is ready to talk about what happened to Ellen. Tigh says he needs a drink to which Adama replies, &quot;Me too.&quot; The two sit down to talk.</text>

Survivor Count: 41,422

The crew of Galactica have reinstated an old military tradition by setting up a boxing ring and putting rank aside — by the placing of dog tags in a metal box — crew and officers freely duke it out in one-on-one matches. Colonel Tigh is match referee.

Elsewhere in a bunk room, Starbuck has finished having sex with her estranged husband Samuel T. Anders. Starbuck remarks that their encounter was just what she needed and gets up to leave. Anders replies that he wants to reconcile their marriage. Starbuck responds that she's not ready yet and heads to the fights.

Kara heads past the boxing match and observes Major Apollo losing a match against Captain &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon. Apollo leaves the ring and picks up his dog tags to signify that he is quitting the competition. However, Starbuck drops her tags in the box and goads an initially reluctant Apollo into fighting her instead.

Admiral Adama arrives with President Roslin, who is a boxing enthusiast, to watch the next series of fights; Kat wins against a female crew member, and Hot Dog is quickly knocked out by Starbuck.

Adama then observes Chief Tyrol and his wife Cally, recalling a moment when the fleet first settled New Caprica and Tyrol and Cally were still assigned to Galactica. Tyrol asked Adama for permission to leave the ship so he and Cally's child could be born and raised down on the planet. Adama refused the request, telling Tyrol he and Cally are needed on board.

Back at the boxing match, Adama overhears Tyrol give one of his crew permission to watch the fight although the crew member has not yet finished fixing a broken spacecraft. Without warning, the Admiral steps into the ring and tells Chief Tyrol to get his &quot;fat, lazy ass&quot; in there with him. Tyrol enters as ordered, thinking the match will be a joke until the bell rings and Adama knocks him to the mat with a fast right hook. Adama taunts Tyrol asking him if this is how he fought down on New Caprica. Insulted, Tyrol rises to his feet and begins to lay into the Admiral. Adama is easily over matched as Tyrol angrily pummels him into the ropes asking if this is what he wanted. Adama is saved for the moment by the bell. Adama sits to rest while Doctor Cottle looks him over. Roslin rushes to Adama's side and gives him some advice on how to win, but Adama replies that he does not intend to win.

Round two begins with Tyrol rushing Adama back into the ropes with more fierce pummelling. Adama does not do much to resist, with his face beaten to a bloody pulp. Tyrol eventually floors the old man who stays down for the count. A stunned silence falls over the crowd as Tyrol and Tigh help Adama back to his feet. The fight is over and Adama takes a moment to tell the crew that he has let them all get &quot;too close&quot; to him, something which must come to an end, and he will no longer forgive laxity among the crew as he's done in the past - he let them drop their guard during the initial settlement of New Caprica and left humanity exposed to the Cylons as a result. As the Admiral leaves, Tigh announces the matches are over and orders everyone back to duty.

Starbuck will not give up her planned fight with Apollo, however. They both enter the ring and let loose with all their bottled up hostilities. As fists fly, flashbacks take the scene back to New Caprica. During the late evening of a ground-breaking ceremony, Apollo and Starbuck found a moment alone to talk. Starbuck had (literally) drunk Anders under the table, and he had passed out cold on the ground, under a table. Apollo took the opportunity to ask Starbuck about her plans for the future, musing about what will become of her relationship with Anders.

Back to the present, the boxing match between Starbuck and Apollo intensifies. Dee watches as Anders remarks that the two look like they'll kill each other.

On New Caprica the two eventually head outside the city to a secluded field and they end up making love. Afterward, Starbuck wonders what will happen if anyone finds out about what they have done — especially Anders or Dee. Apollo stands up and literally shouts to the night sky that he loves Kara Thrace, unconcerned about anyone hearing him. Hesitantly at first, Starbuck eventually does the same shouting that she loves Lee Adama. Apollo says he will tell Dee about the new situation and asks that Starbuck do the same with Anders.

In the boxing ring, Apollo knocks Starbuck to the mat at which point the fighting turns dirty. Starbuck does a leg sweep and trips Apollo. As he gets back to his feet, Starbuck kicks him in the face. Seeing the match is getting personal, the few remaining spectators begin to leave the room.

Flashing to the next morning on New Caprica, Admiral Adama and Roslin talk with Chief Tyrol and Cally. Adama tells Tyrol that he has given the Chief's situation some thought and that he has decided they can remain on New Caprica to have their child. Apollo awakes in the field and finds Starbuck has gone. Returning to the town, he meets his father, who tells him that Starbuck and Anders have just got married in a surprise ceremony earlier that morning. Still reeling from the news, Apollo meets the newlyweds walking down the street. Anders reveals that the wedding was Starbuck's idea and that she &quot;popped the question to him&quot; only that morning. Apollo recovers enough to congratulate Anders and wish him luck, adding that &quot;you're going to need it&quot; as he glances towards Starbuck. Apollo then walks off in a dazed shock back to a Raptor to return to Pegasus, with Dee waiting on the entry ramp. Apollo walks straight from his confrontation with Starbuck to Dee and immediately kisses her.

Back at the boxing ring, Starbuck and Apollo have battled each other to a literal stand-still. They slump against each other in the middle of the ring with their arms around each other. An awkward silence follows, and the spectators shuffle out of the hall. Anders leaves too, while Dee lowers her head. Starbuck whispers to Apollo that she has &quot;missed him&quot;. Apollo replies that he missed her, too. As the scene fades out, there is the trace of a smile upon Starbuck's face.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7162">The fleet's food supply has been contaminated, forcing everyone to subsist on rapidly dwindling food rations. Athena, who has been doing reconnaissance, discovers a planet where abundant algae is found that can be used as a nutritious, if unappetizing, food source. Unfortunately, the planet is located on the other side of a vast, highly radioactive star cluster. Not only is the cluster dangerous, but also the intense light and radiation is blinding to both the naked eye and conventional navigational systems. It is unfortunately too big to go around. The fleet must cross the cluster or risk starvation. Because of the size of the cluster, each ship must jump to a point within it before jumping again to the planet.

Members of Galactica's staff discuss their options, and Admiral Adama proposes that each civilian ship be paired with a [[Raptor]], which will serve as a guide for each ship and direct it safely towards the algae planet. The Raptors are chosen for the mission because their navigational systems are shielded against radiation. Each pilot is issued a white radiation warning badge which turns solid black when the pilot has been exposed to their maximum safe level of radiation. At that point that pilot is to be pulled off the operation.

Following the strategy meeting, Kat is approached by a disheveled-looking man named Enzo who addresses her as &quot;Sasha&quot;. After trying to ignore him, Kat finally tells him emphatically that she is Captain Louanne Katraine, and to stay away from her. She walks away, while the man tells her she cannot deny who she really is. Enzo continues to harass her, trying to get her to cooperate in some unnamed and apparently criminal activity. It is evident that the two know each other, despite Kat's protestations to the contrary.

Starbuck spies on one of their conversations, and she later questions Enzo and then confronts Kat about what she heard. Kat tearfully admits she was once a &quot;trucker&quot; — a smuggler of drugs and of criminals, and says she stole the identity of a woman who had died just prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies. Starbuck says one theory behind the success of the Cylon attack was that the Cylons might have infiltrated Caprica (Cylons having seeded them onto the outer-worlds, and then used criminals to get them into the capital): with aid from smugglers like Kat.

Deeply shaken by the insinuation she is a traitor, Kat retorts at the time the Colonials didn't know some Cylons had human appearances. If any were Cylons, she wasn't aware, and begs Starbuck not to tell Admiral Adama. Kat tells Starbuck she will tell him herself.

Inside the Cylon fleet, Gaius Baltar grows concerned about the strange behavior of a Number Three, who has been periodically wandering off. Wondering what she could possibly be up to, he learns from Number Six that her behavior is causing concern among the other Cylons as well. Baltar confronts Three, learning that she keeps committing suicide and resurrecting, over and over again. Three says that during her resurrections, she sees the five humanoid Cylons that have yet to be revealed, even drawing pictures of them. Baltar, still wondering if he could be a Cylon himself, asks if he is one of the remaining five, but Three says her visions are muddled and she can give no further details.

Meanwhile, back at the Colonial fleet, many of Galactica's pilots help execute Apollo's plan, in which the civilian ships transfer most of their population to Galactica, while the ships are piloted by a skeleton crew. Each Raptor pilot must make sure that the civilian ship under his or her guidance does not get lost while within the blinding, turbulent cluster, and then transmit correct jump coordinates to the ship. As the mission proceeds, the pilots become more and more fatigued and sickened by the intense radiation. Kat in particular is traumatized by the loss of two ships, the [[Adriatic]] (which was being escorted by [[Brendan &quot;Hot Dog&quot; Costanza ]] and the [[Carina]] (which was being escorted by Kat herself).

Kat is plunged into a deep state of depression from a combination of guilt about her false identity, the loss of the ships, and the physical and psychological stresses of flying through the cluster itself. In her depression, she steals a white radiation badge (out of Helo's locker) and uses it to replace her own black one. She also conceals that her hair has started to fall out due to overexposure to radiation.

Kat makes one last attempt to guide a civilian ship, the [[Faru Sadin]] through. This time, like the others, the civilian ship goes adrift and becomes hidden by the brilliant light of the cluster. The mid-cluster jump point rapidly becomes unstable and even more lethal, prompting Admiral Adama to order all Raptors to jump to the planet, whether or not they have located their associated civilian ship. Kat vows not to lose another ship and disobeys the order. In her persistent efforts to locate the lost ship, she is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. She successfully guides the ship to the algae planet. When she returns to Galactica, she is greeted with a round of applause from Adama and much of the Galactica crew, Starbuck included. However, she collapses as soon as she gets out of her Raptor.

Back on the Cylon Basestar, Three and Baltar visit the Basestar's hybrid. This female humanoid, the &quot;soul&quot; of the Basestar itself, lies in a liquid chamber uttering an incoherent rant. Believing every cryptic word the Hybrid utters has meaning, Baltar gets close to her to listen. Against Three's advice, Baltar tries to touch the Hybrid, who immediately grabs Baltar's arm and tells him to find &quot;a hand that lies in the shadow of the light in the eye of the husband of the eye of the cow&quot; before falling back in silence. Baltar and Three try to interpret her oracular words, eventually determining that the eye of the cow is a reference to &quot;cow-eyed&quot; Hera. Hera's husband is the god Jupiter, and the two conclude the &quot;[[Eye of Jupiter]]&quot; is a planet in the shadow of a star cluster - another clue to the location of Earth. Baltar speculates the hand could be a reference to the final five Cylons.

Back at the Colonial fleet, orbiting a planet in the shadow of a star cluster, Starbuck visits the dying Kat in sickbay in remorse over her earlier words to her. She gives Kat a bottle of sleeping pills, &quot;just in case she needs them&quot;. Admiral Adama also visits Kat and tells her that he is promoting her again to CAG, because she had always tried to protect the people under her command. Kat is hesitant to accept, and tells Adama that there is something about her that he should know. Adama just says that whatever she was going to say wouldn't change what she had already accomplished.

The scene changes to a briefing room. All of the Galactica's pilots are gathered in front of a chart listing the command structure of the flight group. The pilots somberly watch as Admiral Adama swaps Kat's name with Apollo's, so making her the CAG.

Later, Starbuck is shown, trying to hold back tears as she affixes Kat's picture to the wall commemorating the missing and deceased. Apollo watches behind her</text>

Survivor Count: 41,402

The refugee fleet has been orbiting an algae planet for two weeks. Members of Galactica have set up a base camp on the surface in an arid ravine while harvesting food supplies from the humid regions. After Starbuck haphazardly lands a Raptor, Apollo admonishes her behavior, but the two soon embrace in a passionate kiss. Apollo wants to stop hiding their feelings for each other and divorce from their respective spouses, but Starbuck says marriage is a sacrament with the Gods that she vowed not to break.

Aboard a Cylon Basestar, Gaius Baltar is awakened by cries of a baby. He follows the cries to a room where the Cylon/Human child Hera is being cared for by Number Eight who tells Baltar the child is sick.

Back on the planet, Chief Tyrol feels strangely compelled to explore some hills near the camp and wanders off. He soon discovers an underground passage leading to an enormous room containing a pillar carved with runes and an ornate symbol. He reports his discovery to Galactica believing that he may have found the &quot;Temple of Five&quot; — a lost tomb mentioned in the Sacred Scrolls that holds the &quot;Eye of Jupiter&quot; — yet another marker left by the Thirteenth Tribe that points the way to Earth. Tyrol mentions the Eye was something his parents once studied religiously.

Almost immediately, four Basestars jump into the planet's orbit. Admiral Adama orders all civilian ships to jump away while Galactica prepares for battle. Colonel Tigh knows they are no match against four Basestars, but Adama says he will not abandon the crew on the surface. Strangely enough, the Basestars hold their position and Baltar calls Galactica requesting they meet with them.

A Cylon Heavy Raider is allowed to land on Galactica where Baltar disembarks along with Number Three, Number Eight, and Cavil. Athena enters the corridor where she identifies Eight as &quot;Boomer&quot;, the one who shot Adama. Tigh tells Boomer her visiting privileges have been revoked and has soldiers detain her while the other Cylons meet with Adama and President Roslin.

Baltar opens the discussion, apologizing for what happened on New Caprica, but Roslin interrupts him telling the Cylons: &quot;The less this man speaks the easier this will go.&quot; Adama tells the Cylons to get to the point, and Three explains that they want the Eye of Jupiter, knowing that the humans have discovered it. In exchange for the Eye, the Cylons will leave the humans alone. Cavil says they'll even throw in Baltar as an &quot;added bonus&quot;. Three warns that if the humans attempt to bring the Eye up from the planet they will be attacked. Adama refuses the offer and threatens that he will destroy the artifact with nukes if the Cylons try to take it by force.

Back in the corridor, Boomer asks Athena if she really knows what happened to her baby, Hera. She reveals that Hera is alive on a Basestar, but has fallen ill and she does not know why. Boomer further explains that the child was found on New Caprica, in the care of a school teacher who worked with Roslin, who probably knew the child was alive the whole time. Athena does not want to believe any of it and quickly storms away. Athena tells her husband Helo about what Boomer said, but Helo refuses to believe they've been lied to.

After the Cylons leave, Adama contacts the base camp informing Apollo of the Cylons' interest in the Eye and asks for a report on Tyrol's progress in deciphering the runes. Tyrol admits he is at a loss, saying he should have paid more attention to his parents' religious teachings. Adama orders Apollo to set up explosives around the temple in case the Cylons try to take it. At this point the Cylons jam communications rendering the wireless useless.

At the base camp, Apollo orders Starbuck, her husband Anders, and Dee to round up the workers and equip them with arms and start fabricating tylium mines. Anders scoffs, stating the workers are no soldiers and they do not stand a chance if attacked. Apollo believed that organizing a militia was Anders's specialty back on Caprica, but Anders argues his militia conducted hit-and-run attacks, not defense of a fixed location. Knowing Anders is being defiant on purpose, Apollo tells him that they need to put their differences aside to which Anders says that he is not blind to what has been going on between Apollo and Starbuck. At this point, Starbuck takes Anders aside telling him that now is not the time for this.

Aboard Galactica, Felix Gaeta informs Adama and Roslin about his recent observations of the star that the algae planet orbits. The blue giant is in a state of imbalance and may go supernova at any time. Gaeta also speculates on the timing that both they and the Cylons have found the Eye just at the moment the star is about to explode. The chances are astronomical and Gaeta feels the find must have a prophetic significance. Adama replies that if events have been ordained by higher powers they must have quite a sense of humour.

Aboard one of the Basestars, the Cylons discuss the current situation. Cavil believes that Adama is bluffing about nuking the planet and that they should attack Galactica now. Leoben says they should not risk the chance and to not take Adama for granted. Regardless, Cavil reminds them they are machines, and will outlast the humans; they can take their time finding Earth without the Eye.

Elsewhere, Three and Baltar visit the Hybrid. Three hopes to gain more insight on the Temple of Five which she believes is connected to the five unseen Cylon models — one of which she believes may be &quot;god&quot; himself. The Hybrid answers Three's queries in her incoherent rant saying something about sins that will be revealed by the &quot;chosen one&quot;. She looks to Baltar directly repeating &quot;the chosen one&quot; over and over. Six soon enters the chamber after eavesdropping, and Three says that she and Baltar must go down to the planet to learn the secrets of the Eye. They are, however, leaving Six behind. With hurt feelings, Six demands to know their intentions; Three says she still loves her, but she is ending their three-way relationship. Going to the temple is something Three and Baltar must do alone.

Back on Galactica, Roslin studies the Sacred Scrolls, searching for clues to the Eye, when Adama enters and informs her that Boomer has told Athena that her baby is still alive. Roslin admits the story is true but before she can explain, Adama leaves in anger. The admiral approaches Helo and Athena and confirms the story. Pained, Athena wants to see Hera, but they know it may be impossible. In the meantime, Adama tells the couple to at least take comfort in knowing that their child is still alive.

Back on the planet, Starbuck flies her Raptor on a recon mission where she soon spots a Centurion emplacement. They fire a missile that damages the Raptor and causes Starbuck to spiral out of control. Apollo soon learns that Starbuck's Raptor was shot down and Anders demands they mount a rescue operation. Apollo says they do not have enough manpower and they must hold the camp. Anders tells Apollo off and starts to head out on his own, but Apollo orders Sergeant Matias to stop him. Matias draws a weapon and points it at Anders's head. Anders turns to Apollo in shocked disbelief.

In space, Galactica's DRADIS detects the launch of six Cylon Heavy Raiders heading toward the planet. Maintaining his vow to destroy the temple, Adama orders the armament of the nukes. The Cylons likewise detect the opening of Galactica's missile doors and prepare for a counter-attack of their own, ending the episode as a mid-season cliffhanger.</text>

The episode begins with the Galactica orbiting the algae planet and arming its nuclear missile tubes. Admiral Adama is ready to launch his nuclear arsenal upon the planet as the Cylons are sending down six Heavy Raiders.

On a Cylon Basestar, the humanoid Cylons clearly see that Adama wasn't bluffing when he warned them he'd destroy the Eye of Jupiter if they invade. They decide to recall their ships; however, a copy of Number Three, betting that Adama won't fire nukes for one ship, openly defies the other models and recalls only five of the Raiders. The sixth, which has Gaius Baltar, D'anna Biers, and Brother Cavil on board, stays on course to the planet. When Adama sees five ships turn back, he stands down his attack. On the basestar, Three's defiance forces the other models to discuss the future of her line.

Down on the planet, Starbuck has survived her crash, but her hands are severely burned. At the base camp, Major Apollo holds Samuel Anders at gunpoint when he demands that Apollo do something to rescue Starbuck. Anders threatens to kill Apollo if Starbuck dies, and Apollo responds that if that happens he'll let him. Apollo then radios his wife Dee, who is out in the field. She says she sees the smoke from Starbuck's crash site and Apollo orders her to intercept it and rescue Starbuck, which puts Anders at ease for the moment.

Back aboard Galactica, Captain &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon and his wife Athena discuss rescuing their child Hera from the Cylons. Athena has a dangerous plan to resurrect her way onto the Cylon ship, but Helo is hesitant to go through with killing her. The two embrace and Helo shoots Athena with his gun. He cries out in despair as Athena dies in his arms.

Down on the planet, Apollo and Anders prepare to defend the camp from approaching Cylon Centurions. They plan an ambush to destroy the robots in a narrow pass and take defensive positions amongst the rocks of a hillside. Meanwhile, Dee makes her way to Starbuck's Raptor. In the process, she is attacked by other Centurions and her partner is killed. She eventually loses her pursuers and arrives at the Raptor surprising Starbuck. With disdain, Dee tells Starbuck she was ordered by Apollo to risk her life to save her. Dee tends to Starbuck's wounds, saying the Raptor looks intact enough to fly despite the crash. With injuries to her hands, however, Starbuck can't pilot it.

Back in space, Athena awakens in a resurrection tank with Caprica Six standing near her. Knowing why Athena has returned, Six takes her to see her child.

Aboard Galactica, Helo stands before Admiral Adama and President Roslin to explain what he has done. Roslin is shocked by the incredible risk he has taken. Adama reminds Helo that Athena knows sensitive information that the Cylons could use against them, but Helo insists that Athena will not betray them. Roslin thinks otherwise, stating that Helo may have put the whole fleet in jeopardy. Helo turns the situation around on her, stating that if she hadn't staged and lied about Hera's death in the first place, the situation would have been different.

Aboard a Basestar, Athena and Six arrive in the nursery where Boomer (the copy of Number Eight who shot Admiral Adama), is caring for Hera. Athena becomes alarmed that the child's stomach is hard as a rock, the sign of possible intestinal blockage. She tells Boomer to fetch a doctor but Boomer says they have already done all they can. Athena decides Hera needs a human doctor and pleads to Six and Boomer to let her take Hera back to Galactica; if not, the first of a &quot;new generation&quot; will die. Six shows sympathy, but Boomer protests the idea.

Athena urges Boomer to come with them saying Tyrol and Adama still have love for her, but Boomer says that part of her life is over. She then threatens to put Hera out of her misery by snapping her neck. As Athena begs for the life of her child, Six sneaks up behind Boomer and knocks her to the floor. When Boomer tries to get up, Six breaks her neck. Athena takes Hera, and she and Six head out to escape the ship.

Back on the planet, Dee has administered painkillers to Starbuck and bandaged her hands. With Starbuck's guidance, Dee begins to repair the avionics systems to get the Raptor back in the air. Elsewhere, the Centurions engage Apollo and Ander's teams and a firefight ensues. They manage to disable a few of the Centurions and force the rest to retreat. Unable to hold the enemy off indefinitely, Apollo calls Tyrol, who is with the Eye of Jupiter, and tells him to get ready to blow up the temple. Tyrol and his people set the last of the charges and leave the temple as Tyrol uncoils the detonator wire out the passage.

In space, the blue giant star of the system begins its supernova stage, blasting off a wave of energy which causes the atmosphere of the algae planet to violently stir. On Galactica, Felix Gaeta alerts Admiral Adama that the stellar event is beginning and estimates an explosion within the hour. Adama orders preparation of the rescue ships.

Back on the planet, Baltar, D'anna and Cavil arrive at the temple and head inside. D'anna and Cavil quickly disable the explosives around the Eye of Jupiter's column as Baltar takes note of the spiral symbol on the floor. He believes the floor pattern must be the Eye, but has no idea how to activate it.

Outside, Apollo's team meets up with Tyrol's people and Apollo orders him to detonate the bombs. Tyrol hesitates, finally stating he can't do it. Apollo grabs the detonator and presses the button himself. Nothing happens. He angrily questions Tyrol, but a thunderous roar from the sky captures everyone's attention. As if symbolically, the mountain spires of the temple frame the expanding glow of the system's star as it shines a brilliant blue. Tyrol believes the view is a sign, saying the nova is the Eye of Jupiter.

Inside the temple, a set of crystal structures at the top of the column begins to glow, casting a beam of light to the spiral symbol on the floor. Baltar believes this is what D'anna has come to see. Cavil notices D'anna becoming enthralled with the artifact. Realizing that she is here only to get a clear vision of the five unknown Cylons, and not the path to Earth, he forbids her to proceed any further and points a gun at her. Cavil is suddenly shot from behind by Baltar.

Standing upon the symbol, D'anna finds herself in a glowing room surrounded by five hooded beings in gleaming white robes. She moves closer to see their faces and instantly recognizes one of them saying, &quot;You! Forgive me, I had no idea.&quot; The being, whose identity remains hidden from the viewer, reaches out to take D'anna's hand, but the scene quickly fades with Baltar taking the figure's place. D'anna is stunned. Her eyes seem to glaze over and blood runs from her nose. Baltar demands to know what she has seen and asks if she saw him as one of the Cylons. She only tells him, &quot;You were right,&quot; and slumps lifelessly to the floor.

Baltar stands in the fading light and begs God to tell him if he is a Cylon before he dies, but he quickly finds a gun to his head. Its holder is Tyrol, who says &quot;Welcome home, Mr. President.&quot; Tyrol then pistol-whips Baltar, knocking him out.

In space, the Cylon Basestars jump away and Adama orders the rescue ships down to the planet.

In Starbuck's Raptor, Dee has repaired the flight systems and takes the controls to make a shaky lift off. Moments later, they join the other rescue ships and fly through a fire-storm as the planet begins to break apart. Once the Raptors land safely, Galactica makes a harrowing FTL jump, barely avoiding the final fatal shockwave from the star that obliterates the algae planet, and safely joins the awaiting civilian fleet. In the hangar, Anders is ecstatic to know Starbuck has made it home and quickly embraces her. Dee and Apollo embrace as well, but Starbuck and Apollo look at each other over their spouses' shoulders.

Emerging from another Raptor is Athena and her baby Hera. From behind Athena emerges Caprica Six, at whom the guards quickly level weapons. Athena briefly stands in front of Six, telling the crowd that Six helped her escape, but then moves aside to join Helo. Six is then taken into custody. Helo is finally reunited with Athena and their child. Tyrol and Cally bring a body bag from their Raptor. Colonel Tigh is shown the bag's occupant: Baltar, alive but unconscious.

Gaeta begins to study the data from the supernova remnant, comparing the burst and color pattern to the Eye of Jupiter symbol. Tyrol believes they are very similar and Roslin wonders if the Thirteenth Colony had a premonition of this event. Colonel Tigh speculates that maybe the tribe saw another nova and drew a picture of it stating, &quot;You seen one nova, you seen them all.&quot; Gaeta thinks the Colonel may be on to something and compares the nova burst to another nova explosion recorded 4000 years ago known as the Ionian Nebula which is 13,000 light years away from their present position. Admiral Adama wonders if the Eye of Jupiter was a &quot;road sign&quot; showing the direction the colony headed to next.

Elsewhere, Helo arrives at Starbuck's bunk where she is recovering from her injuries. He asks her if she has pictures of her apartment back on Caprica. She has him fetch a box from her locker containing the photos, one of which is a picture of a painting Starbuck made when she was a child. The painting is the same swirling pattern of colors as the Eye of Jupiter symbol. Helo remembered seeing the painting in her apartment and asks why she made it, but Starbuck is uncertain, saying she simply liked the pattern. She is shocked by the similarities. Remembering Leoben's claim that she has a destiny, she wonders now if the painting has some prophetic relation to that destiny.

Back aboard the Resurrection Ship, D'anna awakes from her resurrection, finding Cavil next to her. D'anna smiles, having finally seen the five remaining Cylon models, but before she can elaborate, Cavil tells her that her model series has been determined to be fundamentally flawed. The decision has been made to terminate her line and box up her persona indefinitely. Cavil pulls a cartridge from the side of the resurrection tank and the unit powers down as D'anna takes her final breath.</text>

Survivor Count: 41,403

Gaius Baltar, now a prisoner aboard Galactica, sits in the brig and crafts a hanging noose from strips of fabric. Number Six encourages his decision to commit suicide, suggesting that he will soon find out whether he is a Cylon or not. Stirred from his sleep, Felix Gaeta heads down to the brig. He asks the guard permission to see Baltar, but he is refused entry without authorization. At that moment, Baltar hangs himself.

Baltar awakens in a Cylon resurrection tank surrounded by copies of Six. Baltar is ecstatic to be alive as a Six welcomes him back from the dead. However, she quickly turns hostile, telling him he is not a Cylon. The Sixes begin to cut his flesh and attempt to drown him in the liquid. The scene, however, is one of Baltar's hallucinations, and he returns to reality as the guard pulls him down and administers mouth-to-mouth.

In the hangar bay, Apollo introduces Chief Tyrol to &quot;Joe's Bar&quot;, a newly established lounge separated from the rest of the hangar by a makeshift wall.

President Roslin and Admiral Adama sit with Dr. Cottle and Gaeta discussing Baltar's situation. Cottle feels that Baltar's hunger strike and the sleep deprivation imposed upon him aren't helping his mental state. Roslin wants to get information out of Baltar by any means necessary and orders Cottle to force feed him. Gaeta believes that Baltar trusts him and might talk to him but Adama thanks Gaeta for his help and tells him to leave the interrogation to himself and the President.

Apollo returns from the bar intoxicated and his wife Dee sits alone waiting for him. When she confronts him about their dissolving relationship, Apollo insists that he is still devoted to her and married her because he loves her. Dee sees their marriage as a lie and can only love Apollo as long as he and Starbuck allow it. Not wanting to argue any further, Apollo lies down and falls asleep.

Roslin visits Baltar in his cell. She apologizes for the force feeding and asks him again if he was involved in the Cylon sneak attack. Baltar refuses to incriminate himself and demands a trial by jury. Roslin orders Colonel Tigh to jettison Baltar out of an airlock. As they drag him away as he shouts that he is a citizen of the Colonies and entitled to a fair trial. While being dragged down &quot;Memorial Hallway&quot;, Roslin allows Baltar to break free to pull down a photo from the board. He professes his innocence, saying the man in the picture was one of his closest associates and he was godfather to his child. He insists he would never do anything to hurt them. Roslin has Baltar returned to his cell.

Roslin is at a loss after her scare tactics fail. Tigh admits that Baltar is harder to break than he expected. Adama suggests that they administer a powerful hallucinogenic drug, the existence of which was classified. It works off of the subject's fear of death and they will divulge secrets as a survival mechanism. Roslin is shocked to learn of such a drug but approves its use if it will force Baltar to talk.

Samuel Anders doesn't understand how Starbuck handled being manipulated into believing she had a hybrid child with Leoben Conoy back on New Caprica. He also questions Conoy's statements about Starbuck's special destiny. Starbuck remains uncertain herself and does not wish to discuss it any further. Anders tells her that if she really loves Apollo, she should go to him.

Baltar is strapped to a table in the sick bay and given the drug. He falls unconscious and his head is strapped down and then finds himself alone in utter darkness and floating in cold water. Baltar hears Adama's voice from the darkness asking him questions. Baltar tries to answer hoping to be saved from drowning. Under the effects of the drug he recalls the events back on Caprica during the attack — how Caprica Six saved his life by shielding him from the nuclear blast, and that he was an unwitting participant in the Cylon's plans.

Adama asks what the Cylon's interest was in the Eye of Jupiter and if they found the way to Earth. Baltar confesses they were there to discover the identities of the &quot;final five&quot;, the unseen Cylons, wondering if he is a Cylon himself. Baltar now finds himself in a resurrection tank surrounded by figures who are revealed to be children, horribly disfigured and scarred with burns. Roslin asks Baltar what he sees and if he is a Cylon. Baltar responds &quot;no&quot; and falls back to unconsciousness. At this point, Cottle demands that the interrogation end as Baltar's vitals are falling. Adama and Roslin relent their questions and allow Cottle to wake Baltar.

Elsewhere, Apollo and Starbuck have a moment alone to talk. Starbuck asks Apollo if he would be willing to leave Dee if she left Anders. Apollo can't give an answer, citing Starbuck's hasty marriage to Anders after her and Apollo's one-night-stand, to which Starbuck tells him to think about it since it's what he's best at. Apollo, with torn feelings between his wife and Starbuck, heads back to Joe's bar and drinks himself into a stupor. He leaves the bar inebriated, stumbling down a corridor and causing a scene after he trips and drops his wedding ring. He begins kicking containers open in a panic looking for his ring until he collapses in tears.

Meanwhile, Roslin and Adama decide to allow Gaeta to talk to Baltar, hoping he can get some useful information. Unknown to Baltar, a small camera has been installed in the ceiling of the brig to secretly record the conversation. In the cell, Gaeta asks Baltar to at least help him solve the navigation problems he's run into, suggesting to Baltar that if he cooperates he may get better treatment. Baltar looks over Gaeta's charts and begins by correcting his math. When Gaeta glances to the ceiling, Baltar becomes suspicious and notices the camera.

Baltar then accuses Gaeta of deceiving him. Gaeta is confused, but Baltar tells him he knew about his helping the resistance back on New Caprica. He allowed him access to documents knowing Gaeta would sneak them back to the very people who were working against him. Baltar grabs Gaeta's head, whispering something in-audible to the camera (later revealed in season 4 webisodes). Infuriated, Gaeta stabs Baltar in the neck with his pen.

Monitoring from another room, Roslin, Admiral Adama, Cottle and Tigh rush to the cell. Gaeta has Baltar in a strangle hold and is threatening to kill him. Roslin tells him to let Baltar go, saying she knows why Gaeta wanted the opportunity to talk with Baltar — so he could kill him. While Gaeta is distracted, Adama punches him in the face, knocking him unconscious. Baltar is checked out by Cottle, who has him taken to sickbay for the stab wound on his neck, which missed the artery.

Later at Joe's, Apollo sits with Dee while Starbuck and Anders sit at the bar. Apollo tries to reconcile his relationship with his wife, but periodically makes eye contact with Starbuck. Dee takes his hand and he tells her that he did not know what it meant to love her until he was going to lose her.

As Baltar recovers, Adama asks Roslin what she plans to do next. Roslin says Baltar will get his trial.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Added scene

The episode ends with a brief extra scene of Roslin confronting Number Six in her cell. (This scene is truncated in the broadcast, with the full scene made available on Scifi's website at SyFy Video.

Roslin asks Six if she is willing to cooperate in testifying against Baltar in his upcoming trial. Six tells Roslin that she believes that she will be &quot;airlocked&quot; whatever she does. Roslin gives her word that this won't happen, but Six reminds Roslin that she once gave Leoben her word, and then airlocked him anyway. (The broadcast version ends here).

(In the web site version) Six goes on to say that if Baltar is given a fair trial, then she will be chief witness.

This scene can also be found on the DVD release for this episode, as a &quot;Deleted Scene.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8959">The &quot;Previously on Battlestar Galactica&quot; section includes two scenes which were not in the previous episode: civilian refugees are seen boarding Galactica and entering the starboard hangar deck as Chief Tyrol says that Helo has been transferred to the deck to manage them; in the command center, Gaeta informs Adama that there are a 51 Sagittarons in the Thera Sita inhabitants coming aboard, which leads Tigh to utter, &quot;Oh, Boy,&quot; and Adama to say, &quot;Helo may be overmatched down there.&quot;

A sickness has broken out amongst the more than 300 displaced civilians forced to live aboard Galactica in the unused starboard hangar bay which has been nicknamed &quot;Camp Oil Slick&quot; and later &quot;Dogsville&quot;. Part of the hangar has been sectioned off into a medical ward where Captain &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon helps direct the sick to beds while a Caprican physician, Dr. Michael Robert, examines a boy named Willie King. Willie's mother causes a scene when she protests Dr. Robert's examination, stating their Sagittarion faith rejects modern medicine. Dualla, a &quot;Sag&quot; herself, tries to convince the Kings that Robert is here to help them, but Mrs. King seems overly terrified of Dr. Robert.

On Colonial One, President Roslin meets with her aide Tory Foster and Vice President Tom Zarek to discuss the trial of Gaius Baltar. Zarek believes that Baltar's trial could stir chaos within the fleet and warns of assassination plots and riots. He strongly advises Roslin to declare martial law as a precaution during the trial. When Zarek leaves, Roslin and Tory note that Zarek seemed extremely worried about possible unrest.

Aboard Galactica, Roslin meets with Admiral Adama, and Dr. Robert explains the sick have Mellorak, a virus which first attacks the kidneys and later other organs in the body. Dr. Cottle further assures them that Mellorak, while contagious, isn't airborne and is passed only by human contact. If the patients are kept quarantined, there is little risk of an epidemic. Cottle says it is treatable with the vaccine Bittamucin, but only if administered within 48 hours of symptoms. Robert states his agitation of the Sagittarion's refusal for medicine saying they'd rather turn to archaic roots and herbs to cure them. Colonel Tigh shares Robert's resentment of the Sags, calling them a useless and backward people. Because of the shortage of Bittamucin, Robert believes he should ration the drug only to those who display symptoms. Roslin tells Robert to do what he can for them, regardless of their faith.

In Joe's Bar, Dualla and Apollo sit talking with Chief Tyrol, Felix Gaeta, and Racetrack about the current situation. Tyrol shows his animosity toward the Sagittarons by making alcohol-fueled comments about how they refused to fight on New Caprica and that they don't deserve medical treatment. Apollo reminds him that Dualla is a Sagittarion and tells him to &quot;cool it&quot;. Starbuck, who is drinking nearby, has an amused chuckle.

Meanwhile in the brig, Athena meets with Caprica Six who offers words of consolation and encouragement and states that her best chances lie with helping the humans. In an adjacent room, Roslin and Tory watch the discussion through one-way glass. Athena tells Caprica Six that she will see to her being treated fairly during Baltar's trial, but suddenly, Caprica Six's imaginary Baltar appears who asks about Caprica Six's desire to help the humans, speculating that she perhaps wishes to become one of them. Athena leaves saying she will return later with a change of clothes for her. Caprica Six talks to Baltar and they engage in a kiss. When Tory asks what she is doing, Roslin states she's seen this before, that she believes Caprica Six is communicating with someone they can't see.

Elsewhere, Helo deals with an angry group of Sagittarions in a crowded room. They are furious about their treatment under Robert, with several of them calling him a murderer and saying he killed Sagittarions back on New Caprica. Helo believes they are overreacting until Mrs. King pushes her way to the front to inform Helo that her son Willie is dead. Helo believes the Kings waited too long for treatment, but the woman tearfully says her son had the symptoms for only 12 hours.

Later, Helo takes the news of Willie King to Admiral Adama, and Colonel Tigh. He says the Sagittarions are accusing Dr. Robert of singling them out and killing them back on New Caprica. Adama has his doubts, saying Dr. Robert is a respected physician. Helo believes the accusations should be taken seriously and requests Cottle to at least check the records. Adama suggests he let the matter rest and dismisses him.

Helo leaves dejected, and Colonel Tigh angrily follows, confronting him in the corridor. Tigh says Robert is a trusted friend of his and he won't allow Helo to tarnish his credibility. He tells Helo to consider his own situation before he judges others. Helo knows Tigh is referring to Athena and furiously punches Tigh in the face. Guards rush up, but Tigh tells them to stand down, saying he's at least impressed that Helo is still a &quot;man&quot;. He adds that this &quot;little incident&quot; isn't over and walks away, leaving Helo uneasy.

Helo returns to the ward where he gives Mrs. King a religious bracelet Willie wore. She thanks him, adding that Dr. Robert's hatred of the Sagittarions has made him a killer. In explaining the atrocities he carried out on New Caprica, she conveys her fear they will all die if he gets his way. Helo is shaken by her claims.

Next, Helo is alerted by his wife Athena that their daughter Hera has fallen ill. Athena informs Helo that Hera had already been taken to Dr. Robert. Helo rushes as Robert sticks a needle in Hera and asks if this is really necessary. Robert comforts the child, saying everything should clear up in a few hours. He notices Helo's anxiety and asks if there is a problem. Helo pulls his wife and child away, leaving Robert confused. In their quarters, Helo tells Athena about the accusations against Robert and wonders whether Robert also has a grudge against Cylons. To her parents' relief, however, Hera seems fine after her treatment. Nonetheless, Helo is determined to find the truth.

Helo marches down to medical, finding the lights off and no one around. He proceeds to a stack of medical files and begins reviewing them. He finds nearly 90% of the Sagittarions under Robert's care back on New Caprica died, even from the most trivial conditions. Helo is startled by Dr. Cottle, who is furious that Helo won't let the situation go. Helo slams the reports down and demands Cottle look for himself, pointing out that a Sag went to Robert for a broken arm and then suddenly he's pronounced dead hours later. He gives other examples of Sag after Sag dying suspiciously. He begs Cottle to conduct an autopsy on Willie King, to which Cottle says he already had, finding nothing but the antibiotics Robert injected him with. Defeated, Helo relents and walks out.

In the meantime, Dualla, feeling sick herself, asks Dr. Robert to help her. He gives her an injection and she lies down in a bed. At night, Mrs. King informs Helo of Dualla's illness. She is accosted by the guards but Helo rushes down to the hangar ward and finds Dualla lying motionless on a bed. He tries to revive her, but she is unresponsive. Helo tries to carry Dualla out of the infirmary but is intercepted by Dr. Robert. Robert refuses to let them leave and calls the guards to stop them.

An angry Colonel Tigh and Dr. Cottle arrive in the hangar bay. Robert demands that Tigh have Helo arrested, but Tigh shouts at a surprised Robert. Cottle admits that due to fatigue he had not viewed Willie King's bloodwork until a few hours ago; the test had uncovered a deadly toxin in the boy's body and no trace of Bittamucin. Robert had indeed killed him. Robert defends himself by saying that the sick Sags would have died anyway and that by giving them deadly toxins he was shortening their suffering and saving Bittamucin for those more valuable to the fleet. He looks to Tigh for support, saying that he thought Tigh's hatred of Sags was second only to his hatred of Cylons, but Tigh replies that what he hates is being wrong. Tigh tells Helo to arrest Robert.

As Robert is marched out of the hangar bay, Helo meets Mrs. King's gaze as she stands in the crowd. After receiving Admiral Adama's apology, Helo returns home to his wife and daughter.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Added scene

The episode ends with a brief extra scene of Helo admitting to Admiral Adama that he is responsible for the deaths of the infected Cylons (see &quot;A Measure of Salvation&quot;). Adama asks him if he really wants to be confessing this. Helo replies, &quot;Yes, Sir.&quot;

Adama explains that if Helo wishes to proceed, he will have to get a written confession. Helo will most likely face a court martial, and, if convicted, possibly a firing squad. Adama asks again if Helo wants to continue with his confession, to which he responds, &quot;No.&quot; Adama dismisses him.</text>

Survivor Count: 41,398

It has been over a month since the fleet last encountered the Cylons and the crew of the Galactica begins the tedious job of conducting repairs and maintenance to their battered ship. In his quarters, Admiral Adama reflects upon his wedding anniversary, dreaming of his estranged wife Carolanne. Adama is awakened when Colonel Tigh arrives to have him sign off on papers. Tigh reports that since most of the Vipers are out of dry-dock, Chief Galen Tyrol will be checking the servos on Airlock 12. Admiral Adama continues to fantasize of Carolanne, but it is quickly revealed that their relationship wasn't perfect. Carolanne accuses him of putting duty before family which is why she divorced him.

Meanwhile, in their quarters, Chief Tyrol and his wife Cally prepare for repair duty. Galen gets their infant son Nicky ready for daycare while Cally protests having to work when she hoped they could spend the day together. Galen reminds her that duty takes priority over their marriage obligations.

The two arrive at the damaged Airlock 12 with deckhand Seelix who enters the control booth. Cally remains disapproving, questioning why Galen picked her to work with him when she should be taking care of the baby. This starts a quarrel between them. Galen tells her things are different now that they've left New Caprica and are back aboard Galactica. As Seelix overhears the argument through the intercom, an alarm activates and the airlock doors seal shut. Galen tells Seelix to open the door, but she says there's a pressure differential and the doors sealed automatically. Believing it to be a trivial problem, Galen begins to look for a leak and soon finds a small crack in a patch on the bulkhead.

As Adama walks to a meeting with President Roslin, he continues to fantasize about Carolanne, who accuses him of creating a god-like facade for himself and Roslin as an excuse to keep his distance. Adama meets with Roslin who brings up the issue of Gaius Baltar's upcoming trial. She indicates the trial will be problematic because they'd have to pick a common set of laws for the process, but since the colonies each had their own systems of justice she doesn't know which one to use. She says she wants to appoint an honest and dedicated person to organize and conduct the legal research. She requests Adama's son, Apollo, knowing that his grandfather was a respected lawyer. Adama agrees that Apollo is a good choice but says Apollo had never shown an interest in law. Roslin insists and Adama says he will ask him. Roslin then requests to stay on the Galactica for the rest of the day.

In the pilot ready room, Apollo enters to give a briefing. He overhears the pilots chattering about how many days it has been since they encountered the Cylons, which is currently at 49 days. Apollo berates their celebration saying they only need to consider the number &quot;1&quot; — since &quot;one slip-up&quot; is all it takes to jeopardize the fleet. Adama watches his son's stern lecture from the doorway as Carolanne's image returns to his mind. She scoffs at the fact that he never tells Lee how much he loves him and that he lets performance reviews express his feelings instead of words. Afterwards, Adama tells his son of Roslin's request that he handle the legal proceedings. Apollo is flattered saying he remembers looking through his grandfather's legal textbooks and that he briefly considered becoming a lawyer instead of joining the military. Apollo refuses because the duties of the CAG already consume all his time.

Meanwhile, the situation in the airlock grows critical. Galen's temporary patch of the hole doesn't hold and the breach expands further. He and his wife are beginning to freeze and rapidly losing air. By now, Admiral Adama has been alerted of the crisis and goes to the control room to assess the situation. Adama is frustrated that the backup systems can't be activated, and Apollo explains that extensive battle damage to Airlock 12 knocked out the bypass. Colonel Tigh suggests using explosives to break through the window of the control booth, but Apollo says the window is too strongly reinforced. The amount of explosive necessary to breach it would kill the Tyrols in the blast.

The only option left is a harrowing plan to blow the exterior hatch and rescue them with a Raptor. Adama informs Galen of the plan saying they are taking them &quot;out the front door&quot;. Galen asks if they're planning on setting up a docking collar, but Adama replies that there isn't enough time. Cally is visibly shaken and fears they won't survive the explosive egress. Adama tells her not to worry, assuring that people have survived exposure to vacuum for as long as a minute. She begins to worry about Nicky, telling her husband that she knows what happens to orphaned children in the fleet. While Galen moves loose objects closer to the airlock so that they won't be struck during the decompression, Cally asks the Admiral that if anything should happens to them, would he see to Nicky being given to a woman in the fleet named Susan Settler. Adama promises that he'll see to it and tells them to get ready.

Outside the airlock, Athena pilots a Raptor up to the exterior hatch. Inside, Apollo and Starbuck open the side hatch and ready themselves to catch the Tyrols as they are blown out into space. In the airlock, Galen takes tight hold of Cally. He apologizes for being selfish with forcing her to work with him, but admits that he just wanted to enjoy her company. The hatch is blown sending the Tyrols and several cargo containers into space. The Raptor narrowly avoids being struck by the debris and Apollo and Starbuck catch the Tyrols safely. Apollo reports they are alive, but in rough shape.

Once back aboard, Apollo sits with his father reminiscing about his mother Carolanne. He explains that after the divorce, Carolanne took to drinking heavily. Despite his father's devotion to her, he believes his mother never truly loved him.

Down in sickbay, Galen and Cally recover from their incident. Seelix brings Nicky to see his father who painfully rests in a bed. He finds the strength to get to his feet and carries Nicky to Cally, who is in a hyperbaric chamber recovering from decompression sickness.

Meanwhile, Apollo returns to his quarters where his wife Dee tells him that his father sent down a box for him. Apollo is amazed to find it filled with his grandfather's old legal books and shocked that his father had even kept them.

Elsewhere, Admiral Adama has another meeting with Roslin. He brings up a past conversation of hers where she said that if they'd have stayed on New Caprica, she would have found a nice secluded place to build a cabin. She says Baltar's inept leadership and New Caprica's terrain would have made it too difficult. She wonders however, if the Cylons had never returned, would he have eventually left Galactica to settle down himself. He evades the question saying it would have been irrelevant anyway. The image of Carolanne returns to his thoughts who tells him that she knows he would have eventually. As Adama leaves, Roslin says she would have indeed built the cabin.

Adama returns to his quarters and takes one last look at his wedding photo before putting it back inside his locker.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Added scene

The episode ends with a brief extra scene which takes place earlier in the episode before Colonel Tigh takes maintenance reports to Adama. The scene shows Felix Gaeta walking through a corridor with Dee. Felix says that he has taken notice that the Admiral and the President seem to be spending quite a bit of time together. Dee wonders what he's implying where Gaeta believes there may be an intimate relationship forming.

The rest of the scene continues (available on Syfy.com and as a deleted scene on the DVD release) and shows Gaeta and Dee staring at each other in contemplation of the idea. The two soon begin to laugh hysterically until Colonel Tigh walks up and asks what is so funny. Gaeta and Dee come to attention and state that it's nothing. Tigh takes the reports away and when the coast is clear, the two resume their laughter.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8663">A Raptor piloted by Racetrack experiences engine failure soon after launch and collides with Colonial One, nearly killing President Roslin and her aide Tory Foster. An investigation reveals that a recent batch of Tylium fuel contains impurities and Roslin calls upon Zeno Fenner, the director of the fleet's refinery ship, for answers. When Fenner meets Roslin and Admiral Adama, he is sarcastic and uncooperative, calling the situation a &quot;glitch.&quot; He admits that it may be his workers' way of getting some attention after repeatedly being ignored regarding the squalid and dangerous conditions they face every day without a single break. Roslin doesn't sympathize, explaining that fuel production is critical and must be maintained. When Fenner quotes text from an underground book by Gaius Baltar, &quot;If you hear the people, you never have to fear the people&quot; and threatens a few more &quot;glitches,&quot; Roslin has him arrested.

Adama is stunned by her action and inquires about the book. Visibly angered, Roslin whispers that Gaius Baltar's attorney has passed a manuscript around the fleet written by Baltar entitled, My Triumphs, My Mistakes. It deals with class struggle, and she says she is thinking about having a &quot;good ol' fashioned book burning.&quot; Adama contacts Chief Tyrol, informs him of Fenner's arrest, and orders him to go to the refinery ship to take charge of the situation. Tyrol's wife Cally admits to Tyrol that she has read Baltar's book, which discusses the unfair labor differences between the people of the Twelve Colonies. She questions why the people from the poorer colonies like Gemenon, Sagittaron, and Aerelon are forced to work in harsh blue-collar jobs while the more elite and educated colonials from places like Caprica, Tauron and Virgon get to keep their plush white-collar jobs.

Roslin goes to Baltar's cell and demands that he hand over the pages from his book. She lies, saying it was intercepted before anyone could read it, and orders the guards to tear the room apart. She concludes with a partial strip search of Baltar during which Six appears in Baltar's mind and tells him to protect his dignity. Six slides her hand into his open pants, but Baltar stops her. He withdraws the pages of his book and surrenders them to Roslin, who sneers that she's been &quot;dying to see how it ends&quot; and mocks his attempt to appear as a &quot;man of the people.&quot;

Meanwhile, Tyrol arrives on the refinery ship and takes a tour of the facility, led by a foreman named Cavett. He witnesses the somber glances from the tired, grime-covered workers who are both men and women ranging in age from the elderly to mere children. Tyrol goes to the massive Tylium storage room where a single, dwindling pile of ore remains. Cavett says they're lucky if the supply lasts long enough to get them out of the system. Next, Tyrol goes to the main conveyor line where the work has completely shut down. Tyrol asks for a reason for the shutdown, but the workers remain silently defiant until a young boy named Milo speaks up and says the pressure seals are broken. Tyrol notices that the seals are completely missing and have been removed by the workers in protest of Fenner's arrest.

Tyrol returns to Galactica and informs Roslin and Adama of the missing seals and explains the workers are buying time for their pleas to be heard. He adds that some of the workers have been doing the same grueling job since the attack on the Colonies and requests Roslin cede to some of their demands for a break. Roslin objects, however, saying it is just as difficult to work aboard the algae processing, recycling and waste handling ships. She sees their work stoppage as extortion and demands the names of the organizers. Tyrol hesitantly surrenders Cavett's name.

Cavett is arrested and joins Fenner in an adjacent cell. When Tyrol visits them, he finds that Cavett is having a breakdown and injuring himself. Fenner reminds Tyrol that Cavett was tortured by the Cylons back on New Caprica, and confinement is causing him post-traumatic stress. Tyrol tells Fenner there is no time for games and demands Cavett reveal where the seals have been hidden. Fenner hesitates, then angrily reveals that they were hidden in the air vents. Tyrol then has the men released and work is resumed aboard the refinery ship.

Later, Tyrol goes to Colonial One to talk to Roslin. He explains parents are passing down their skills to their children, and they are forever stuck doing the same job in the next generation. He says they should be given a chance to choose their future. Roslin understands the problem and tells him to make a list of colonists with relevant skills to supplement those aboard the labor ships. Next, Tyrol deals with a protesting young man named Danny Noon who was pulled from Dogsville. Noon had worked a summer job on a farm to earn money for college, but agriculture is not his career choice. Tyrol tells him the job is only temporary and has the angry youth escorted away.

Tyrol then finds a copy of Baltar's book and opens to a page entitled The Emerging Aristocracy and the Emerging Underclass. Tyrol goes to Baltar's cell and refers to the book. Baltar learns the truth that the book has been leaked and asks Tyrol what he thinks about it. Tyrol responds that he thinks it's a load of crap, disbelieving Baltar's claim that he grew up on a farm on Aerelon - especially since Baltar's accent is different from other Aerelons he knows. Baltar, speaking in an Aerelon accent, states that he learned to mimic the Caprican accent to help hide the fact he was from Aerelon, a poor farming world known as the &quot;food basket for the twelve worlds.&quot; Baltar explains the purpose of the book was to show that class-strife has continued to follow the fleet well after the Cylon attack, and they will find that those in the aristocracy will continue to hold onto their power.

Tyrol returns to the refinery ship where work halts when the conveyor system becomes jammed. Fenner says the belt must be repaired or else a back-up will occur which could cause the &quot;hot&quot; Tylium further down the line to go critical and cause a chain reaction that will take out the whole ship. Without stopping the slipping belt, Tyrol finds the problem is a jammed drive mechanism, but he is unable to reach it. Danny Noon frees the jam but injures his arm in the processes. Fed up, Tyrol walks to main control levers and shuts down the entire factory. He declares the workers to be on strike.

Aboard Galactica, Starbuck finds her flight mission delayed by hangar workers who are playing cards on a Raptor wing. She demands they get back to work where the senior deckhand, Pollux, tells her that they are only servicing vital missions per orders from Chief Tyrol. Tyrol is immediately arrested. Admiral Adama angrily confronts Tyrol in the brig and orders him to call off the work stoppage, but Tyrol refuses. Adama says he will not tolerate the disobedience of orders, calling it mutiny and reminding him that mutineers are shot, but Tyrol stays put. Adama grabs the phone and orders the arrest of Cally. Alarmed, Tyrol asks what he's doing. To get his point across, Adama says he will execute Cally as mutineer and continue with the rebellious deck crew if he has to. He admits it's something he doesn't want to do, but will to maintain the survival of the fleet. Tyrol relents and calls off the strike. Adama tells him to report to Roslin who wishes to discuss the labor situation.

Tyrol meets with Roslin on Colonial One and they talk about the cultural vocations that some colonists are locked into by birth. Tyrol suggests setting up a training program to allow the colonists to learn more than one trade, and a work rotation started so that those in dangerous and dirty jobs get an equal chance to work in more comfortable and safer positions in the fleet. He adds that he'd like to see some of Colonial One's crew get their hands dirty for a change. Roslin agrees, but tells Tyrol to consider the reestablishment of the worker's union that he led back on New Caprica as it will ensure stability within the fleet.

Later, Tyrol calls his deck crew to muster when Starbuck arrives and demands to know why Seelix is 20 minutes late for her first day of pilot training. Seelix is confused and Tyrol apologizes, explaining that Seelix has been promoted to Ensign and assigned to flight training - something she was turned down for earlier because her job as an avionics specialist was too important. Tyrol pins the Ensign rank on her collar and salutes her while Starbuck tells the newly recruited nugget to double-time it to debriefing. Seelix rushes off with an excited smile on her face.</text>

Survivor Count: 41,400

The episode begins with Starbuck restlessly asleep in her bunk and having a dream in which she finds herself in her apartment on Caprica painting the Eye of Jupiter on her wall. She becomes frustrated and splashes white paint over her artwork as the Cylon Leoben Conoy approaches her from behind. The two begin to aggressively make love until Starbuck awakens, breathing heavily.

Later, Starbuck talks with Helo, who learns of her strange dreams and suggests she see an oracle. During the discussion, Starbuck catches a glimpse of a little beaten girl in a mirror; it is her younger self. Turning about, the child is not there. Starbuck then heads to Dogsville in the hangar and sees the oracle, Yolanda Brenn. She enters the tent, finding a small winged figurine. Suddenly, Brenn speaks from the shadows, explaining that the figurine is a depiction of the goddess Aurora, who signifies change and allows Starbuck to keep it. Before Starbuck can say much, Brenn says she knows why she came. She says she knows of Leoben and the dreams, repeating word-for-word Leoben's remarks of Starbuck's destiny. She tells Starbuck that it all means that her mother, Socrata Thrace (Dorothy Lyman), is trying to tell her something important. Angry and afraid, Starbuck quickly leaves.

Meanwhile, the fleet is undergoing fuel replenishment in the orbit of a gas giant, using the planet's radiation to help hide their presence from the Cylons. After an assignation with her husband, Anders, Starbuck tells him about some of the abuse she endured at the hands of her mother. Starbuck says that her mother had an intense phobia of insects. Starbuck was angry with her mother one day, and hid plastic insects in her mother's shoes. As punishment, her mother slammed Starbuck's hand repeatedly in a door.

Later, Starbuck and Hot Dog are on patrol, piloting their Vipers in the clouds of the gas giant. Starbuck catches sight of a Cylon Heavy Raider and gives chase. Because of the radiation, the DRADIS is blind and Hot Dog is unable to get a confirmation of the ship. He soon loses sight of Starbuck, who remains in hot pursuit of the Cylon. In orbit, Admiral Adama aborts the refuelling and orders the fleet to prepare for a jump. Starbuck dogfights the Cylon through the clouds, eventually entering a swirling storm into which the Cylon dives. Strangely, the clouds take on the red, blue and yellow colors of the Eye of Jupiter. Determined to kill the Cylon, Starbuck maintains her pursuit, ignoring the frantic calls from Apollo to pull up before she is crushed by the increasing atmospheric pressure below the cloud deck.

After seeing glimpses of her apartment between flashes of lightning and the outline of her mother standing in the room, Starbuck finally comes to her senses and returns to Galactica. Once aboard, she is shocked by Chief Tyrol's claim that her Viper has no visible damage, even though she felt bullet impacts. Likewise, her gun camera footage shows she was firing at nothing. Admiral Adama meets with Apollo, asking his son if he thinks Starbuck is losing her mind. Apollo says he will talk to her and later finds Starbuck sitting in Memorial Hallway, staring at the pictures on the wall. She tells him if she dies first, he is to place her photo right next to the photo of Kat. Apollo promises, but says if he dies first, he wants to be placed next to the photo of Duck and Nora, who were both lost on New Caprica. Starbuck asks his decision about her flight readiness and he gives her some words of encouragement. Meanwhile, she observes dripping candle wax taking the pattern and colors of the Eye. When Starbuck passes Admiral Adama and President Roslin, she gives the figurine of Aurora to Adama, saying it would make a great figurehead for the model sailing ship in his quarters.

Preparing for her next flight mission, Starbuck stops herself from entering her Viper cockpit when she sees her younger self sitting in the seat. Visibly shaken, she tells Apollo she is unable to trust herself and cannot fly. Apollo comforts her by offering to be her wingman for the flight.

Once more in the sky of the planet, Starbuck catches sight of the Heavy Raider and engages pursuit. Apollo's scopes show no sign of the bogey and he chases after Starbuck, but he quickly loses sight of her. Starbuck again chases the Raider into the swirling storm, where the Cylon turns around and nearly collides with her. Suddenly, the Viper's cockpit canopy is punctured and Starbuck passes out as her fighter begins a wild spin. The cockpit alarms change to the alarm of a clock and the scene changes to Starbuck lying in bed in her apartment on Caprica. She turns the off the clock and immediately finds Leoben sitting by her side.

Starbuck believes she is being tricked again and that this is all a dream or some Cylon mind-game. Leoben assures her that he is there to give her a chance at something she avoided in her past. He gently takes her hand and leads her into another scene change, this time it is her mother's apartment. Fearful, Starbuck sees herself, six years prior, entering her mother's kitchen dressed in her fleet officer uniform. Her mother sits reading a paper and smoking a cigarette. Hoping for some congratulations from her mother for having graduated flight school and becoming an officer, Starbuck instead receives an admonishment for graduating 16th in her class. Starbuck tells her she was 16th out of 117 cadets. Angered, her mother tells her she should have been number one. Starbuck retaliates, thinking that her mother is jealous because she never became an officer, despite having served as a decorated Marine Corporal in the first Cylon War.

Starbuck then notices a medical paper on the table and grabs it despite her mother's objection. The report says her mother has terminal cancer. Starbuck offers sympathy, but her mother rejects it, saying that Starbuck should have pity for herself. In anger, Starbuck walks out the door, vowing to never return and that her mother can die alone. Starbuck relives the moment and sobs.

Leoben then takes her to the bedroom where her mother lies on her deathbed and gives Starbuck another chance to be with her mother as she dies. Starbuck sits next to the bed and notices her mother holds a scrapbook filled with all her childhood drawings, including the swirling Eye. Starbuck takes her mother's hand as she tells her that she is happy she came back. She presses her daughter's hand against her face as she takes her final breath. Starbuck quietly sobs, but is partially relieved to have been at her mother's final moments. Leoben tells her that death is not hard to embrace, and that is the message her mother was trying to tell her all along. Starbuck finally sees Leoben as something else, perhaps not a Cylon, but her spiritual guardian. Leoben says he never claimed he was actually Leoben.

In reality, Starbuck finally awakens to the shouts of Apollo begging her to come back. She moves her hand near the ejection seat lever on her Viper before telling him that she is no longer afraid and will &quot;see him on the other side&quot;. Apollo demands that she pull up, but she whispers, &quot;just let me go... they're waiting for me&quot;. Apollo then sees an explosion as Starbuck's Viper breaks apart and disintegrates. With no sign that she ejected, Apollo cries out in despair. In orbit, Admiral Adama asks if Apollo has visual contact with Starbuck. Apollo replies &quot;negative...she went in&quot;. Adama orders search-and-rescue ships to be dispatched, but Apollo tells him that Starbuck is gone; there is nothing to find. There is stunned silence across the bridge.

Later, Admiral Adama sits quietly in his quarters looking at the Aurora figurine. He sees that it is a perfect fit for the prow of his sailing ship, but in grief and anger, he smashes the model to pieces and begins to sob.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Deleted scene

Starbuck is inspecting her Viper when she finds a red liquid that looks like blood. She asks Tyrol what the substance is, to which he replies that its hydraulic fluid and says all the birds leak fluid. She angrily demands that he fix the problem, but Tyrol says the seals are worn and replacements are scarce. He promises that the problem is minor and her Viper will fly, but Starbuck does not believe him. Apollo arrives and takes Starbuck aside to cool her temper.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4107">Part 1

President Roslin and Athena share the same vision of chasing Hera Agathon through the ancient opera house on Kobol, where they also encounter Caprica Six. At Joe's Bar, Colonel Tigh and Samuel Anders share a different form of vision, ethereal music that only the two of them are able to hear.

Just before Baltar's trial is set to begin, Cassidy refuses Roslin's request that Baltar be tried for conspiring with the Cylons. Meanwhile, Baltar is visited in the brig by a woman who asks him to bless her child. He refuses, but she reaffirms her belief in him nonetheless.

Although the fleet is nearing the Ionian Nebula, and has not encountered the Cylons for weeks, Adama is unconvinced that the fleet has truly outrun them. His suspicions are confirmed when Racetrack's trailing Raptor narrowly dodges an attack by a massive Cylon fleet. When Tigh questions Caprica Six, she informs him that the Cylons had found a way to track the fleet's Refinery Ship. The interrogation turns to blows when Six takes her imaginary Baltar's suggestion to bring up Tigh's wife. Shaken, Tigh has Six shackled.

At the beginning of the trial, Cassidy's opening arguments rest on Baltar having been a failed leader and the devastating loss of 5,197 people on New Caprica. Defense attorney Romo Lampkin opens by condemning Baltar in the harshest terms, finally obtaining an unruly shout from a member of the gallery. Lampkin uses the outburst to turn his arguments abruptly into the notion that Baltar is being railroaded to execution and that the trial is being held as a formality over top of the carnal desire to punish Baltar beyond any blame he deserved. Lampkin also takes advantage of Roslin's arrival at the courtroom to suggest that she would have pursued confrontation with the Cylons, and gotten more people killed than Baltar had by unconditional surrender.

The trial moves further into Baltar's favor when Colonel Tigh takes the witness stand and admits to masterminding the New Caprica Police graduation bombing (see Occupation), with Baltar as the primary target. After Cassidy opens up the subject by suggesting that Ellen is another victim of Baltar, Lampkin pushes him into eventually confessing to killing Ellen. Lampkin also coaxes Tigh into admitting his drinking problem, and Tigh further degrades his own position when he again hears the ethereal music and angrily yells for it to be turned off. He is effectively barred as a witness after repeatedly admitting that he would do or say anything to see Baltar executed.

When Roslin herself takes the witness stand, she confirms for Lee Adama that Baltar helped save her life during her bout with cancer a year beforehand, and later also confirms, over the objections of Adama, that she had resumed taking medication because her cancer had returned. As the chamalla has hallucinogenic side effects, Roslin's credibility is seriously damaged.

During a recess in the trial, Romo Lampkin asks Lee Adama to consider that his role in the trial may get him expelled from the &quot;aristocracy&quot; of the Adama family in the fleet. Soon afterwards, Lee argues with his father over the principle of trying Baltar. Admiral Adama confirms that the trial is a formality and that he already feels Baltar is guilty. He also condemns Lee for the damage done to Saul, though Lee had no knowledge of Ellen Tigh's death, much less that Saul murdered her. In disgust, Lee resigns his commission, and Adama almost happily accepts it. Later, in their quarters, Dualla takes Lee's role in the trial as the final straw to break their troubled marriage, packs her things and leaves over his pleas to stay.

On Colonial One, Roslin is badgered with questions from reporters about the resurgence of her cancer. Tory Foster, suffering from constantly hearing the music in the same way as Colonel Tigh, angrily tells the reporters to stop prying into Roslin's personal affairs, earning her a private reprimand from Roslin. On Galactica's bridge, Felix Gaeta and Helo review a plan to use the refinery ship as a decoy to lure the Cylons off course, and brood over a gathering storm</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3486">Part 2

As Anders and Tory continue to hear the strange music and begin making love, Chief Tyrol is awakened by the music. Both he and Colonel Tigh begin their own searches for its source, but neither can find it. On the hangar deck, Anders realizes that Tyrol is humming the strange music, and the two agree that it sounds like something from childhood.

After receiving an injection for her cancer treatments in sickbay, Roslin has another vision of the opera house on Kobol. Also in sickbay, Sharon enters the same vision while holding Hera in her arms and both women wake up screaming. Sharon confirms having shared the experience and likens it to the Cylon ability of &quot;projection.&quot; They proceed to question Caprica Six in her cell, and immediately discover that she was in the same dream. Caprica talks of feeling compelled to protect Hera.

The trial resumes and Gaeta takes the witness stand. He perjures himself by saying that Baltar willingly signed the death order to have Roslin, Zarek, and others executed. Rather than attempting to prove this during cross-examination, however, Lampkin acts on Lee Adama's suggestion and moves for a mistrial, based on prejudicial statements Admiral Adama had made to Lee concerning Baltar's guilt and the trial's outcome. Lee then takes the witness stand, but refuses to testify against his father, instead returning to Lampkin's original line of argument that Baltar, for all his failings, could not be faulted for the tragedy on New Caprica.

By a vote of 3 to 2, the tribunal finds him not guilty and the courtroom erupts in furor. His service having been completed, Lampkin abandons Baltar. Reflecting on the trial, Baltar wonders how he will survive. In CIC, Admiral Adama admits to Roslin's dissatisfaction that he was one of the &quot;not guilty&quot; voters.

When the fleet makes the final jump into the Ionian Nebula, Roslin feels faint and a few seconds later all of the ships suffer a power outage and drift. The Galactica crew struggles to restore power. Moving through the darkness and trying to hide his face, Baltar is suddenly surrounded by three people, including the woman who had asked him to bless her child. They take him to what they tell him is &quot;[his] new life.&quot;

Caprica Six returns again to the opera house and sees herself, Baltar and Hera looking up at the glowing, robed apparitions of the Final Five Cylons looking down on them from a balcony. Compelled by their own shared auditory hallucination, Tory, Colonel Tigh, Tyrol, and Anders converge on the Galactica gym, where they all hum the melody together, then sing the lyrics, and come to the distressing conclusion that they are all Cylons. When power is restored, DRADIS identifies four Cylon basestars bearing down on the fleet and Admiral Adama orders general quarters. All of the newly discovered Cylons return to their posts but are wary of what they might do. As the other pilots scramble to their ships, Lee returns to his locker to grab his flight gear, despite having been removed from flight status.

After launch, Apollo separates from the other Vipers to chase a new DRADIS contact in the nebula. The contact turns out to be Starbuck; she tells a surprised Apollo that she has found Earth, and that she will lead them there.

As the Cylon and Galactica fleets prepare for battle, the camera zooms out (to show the entire galaxy), and zooms back (also with a 2D rotation of 180 degrees clockwise) in elsewhere in the galaxy to show a single planet: Earth.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3605">&quot;He That Believeth in Me&quot; is the third episode in the fourth season (as the producers regard the two-hour movie special Razor as the first two episodes) of the reimagined science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica. The episode aired on SCI FI and Space in the United States and Canada respectively on April 4, 2008, and aired on Sky1 in the United Kingdom on April 15, along with the following episode &quot;Six of One&quot;. The episode's title is a reference to the Book of John, chapter 11:25-26 in the New Testament of the Bible, which quotes; &quot;Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live...&quot; The episode was generally well received and also won an Emmy Award.

Following the events in &quot;Crossroads, Part 2&quot;, the fleet arrive in the Ionian Nebula to find a clue that will lead to Earth, only to find that the entire rag tag fleet had mysteriously powered down, and hopelessly surrounded by Cylons. Lee Adama also encounters Kara Thrace, who was thought to have been killed in &quot;Maelstrom&quot; and claims to know where Earth is. The episode also deals with the aftermath of the identity of four of the five final Cylons, Samuel Anders, Tory Foster, Saul Tigh, and Galen Tyrol. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,698.

Plot

While Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) and a newly returned Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) head to Galactica, the advancing Cylons destroy one ship and damage others, killing at least 600. After discovering their true identities, Cylons Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan), Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma), Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) continue their jobs. Tigh is ordered to send every Viper to defend the fleet, but has a vision where he assassinates Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) before carrying it out. New Viper pilot Anders is sent out, worried that a hidden Cylon program would make him turn against the fleet. His guns are unresponsive while targeting a Raider, which turns around to face him. Anders' iris glows red which causes the Raiders to retreat to their basestar and jump away, much to the surprise of the fleet.[1]

Gaius Baltar (James Callis) is taken to a monotheistic cult which has erected a shrine to him. One of the members, Jeanne (Keegan Connor Tracy), believes he can save her dying son. Though reluctant at first, Baltar prays and asks &quot;the one true god&quot; to take his life instead, as he caused the genocide of the twelve colonies and the child is innocent. The next day he is escorted to a bathroom to shave. Charlie Connor (Ryan Robbins), whose son was killed on New Caprica, plans to kill him. Instead of begging for his life, Baltar begs Connor to kill him. His escort breaks free and brutally attacks the captors. After the two return to the cult, Baltar is astonished to find that the boy has been miraculously cured.[1]

Starbuck returns with a seemingly brand new (Mk II) Viper. She doesn't recall being killed and believes that she was only gone for six hours. President Roslin (Mary McDonnell) believes that Starbuck is a Cylon, despite her having been cleared by the Cylon detector. Starbuck claims to know the location of Earth and insists that following the clue from the Eye of Jupiter is a mistake. Every time the fleet performs an FTL jump, her &quot;feeling&quot; of Earth's location fades after experiencing a short headache. Her attempts to convince Roslin fail. After another jump and headache, desperate to stop Roslin before her feeling fades forever, she subdues the Marines guarding Adama's quarters and holds Roslin at gunpoint.[1</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">&quot;The Ties That Bind&quot; is the fifth episode in the fourth season of the reimagined science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica. The episode originally aired on SCI FI and Space in the United States and Canada respectively on April 18, 2008, and on Sky1 in the United Kingdom on April 22. The episode's title is a reference to a Christian hymn, &quot;Blessed Be the Tie that Binds&quot;.

The episode mainly focuses on the four of the final five Cylons, particularly Galen Tyrol, as his relationship with his wife, Cally becomes even more strained. Meanwhile, Kara Thrace and her team on the Demetrius start their search for Earth. The episode also deals with the significant six Cylons after three of the models decide to force the other three not to lobotomize the Raiders, which leads the two factions to a civil war. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,676.



Plot

A Brother Cavil model resurrects from the dead after one of the Sixes (Natalie) starts a rebellion to unbox the Three models to learn the identity of the final five. Surprisingly, Cavil agrees to this. They decide to send a fleet of basestars and a resurrection ship to the location where the Threes were boxed. However, when they get there, the resurrection ship does not follow. Instead, Cavil's baseships circle the rebels and proceed to destroy them. Meanwhile on the Demetrius, Kara Thrace and her crew have been searching for Earth by Starbuck's vision for 22 days without any success. The patience of the crew starts to wear thin.

In the ragtag fleet, Lee Adama becomes the Caprican delegate for the Quorum of Twelve, though the media's real attention is on the missing Demetrius, and its &quot;classified military assignment&quot;. Lee is then paid a visit by Tom Zarek, who tells him that Roslin and Adama have continued to suppress information and believes the Demetrius affair will create more tension if Roslin doesn't come clean about its mission. He ends saying that he hopes, as a Quorum member, Lee will not ignore the truth, which he doesn't as he brings up another issue; Executive Order 112, which deals with the method by which the President establishes a tribunal and he believes it gives the President too much power. Roslin responds that she intended to discuss the order at the next Quorum meeting.

On Galactica, Crew Chief Galen Tyrol and Cally's relationship becomes even more strained. Cally soon attempts to spy on him, believing he is having an affair. She catches him talking to Tory Foster at Joe's bar. Afterward, she finds a note from Saul Tigh. She follows Tyrol again, where she eavesdrops on the meeting between Tyrol, Tory and Tigh. To her horror, she soon learns that they are Cylons. When the group breaks apart, Tory is the last one out of the compartment and notices an out of place tile, leading her to believe that someone listened in on their conversation. Cally rushes to her quarters to beat Chief Tyrol back and when his guard is lowered, knocks him out with a wrench. Cally proceeds to grab her son Nicky, and attempts to commit murder-suicide by having her and her child vent into space in a launch tube. Tory follows and attempts to talk Cally into not doing it, since they had no idea they were Cylons until the Ionian Nebula, and that they are not evil. Eventually, Tory takes the baby and knocks Cally out. After she regains consciousness, Tory, holding the baby in another room, presses the launch button, venting Cally into space. Later, Admiral Adama gives Galen the bad news that Cally is dead</text>

The episode begins as Chief Galen Tyrol holds a memorial service for his late wife Cally. During the service, President Laura Roslin tells Admiral Adama that she would like a similar service when she dies. As the service concludes, Tory Foster tries to convey her condolences to Tyrol.

Colonel Tigh and Tory later meet the Chief in his quarters. There, he confesses that he is still confused by his Cylon identity, but Tory tries to persuade him that he is perfect and that they are superior to humans. She suggests that he &quot;switch off&quot; his guilt, but Tigh vehemently disagrees saying that grief is human.

Meanwhile, Tory Foster visits Gaius Baltar in his sect's quarters. As she seduces him while bringing him pain, a group of masked men break in, launch tear gas, deface Baltar's shrine and beat up anyone they can find. They demand Baltar surrender himself, but he hides in his alcove. The intruders flee when security arrives. After the attack, Baltar comforts an older woman who is praying to Asclepius, a god of healing.

An investigation is launched and Baltar is informed that the attackers are known as &quot;The Sons of Ares&quot; – a religious sect opposed to Baltar's monotheistic teachings. &quot;Head Six&quot; appears to him and says that it seems &quot;the old gods are fighting back.&quot; She encourages Baltar to coordinate a counter-attack and he makes a speech in which he calls upon his followers to cast aside their fear and retaliate. Later, Baltar and his followers break into a polytheistic religious ceremony to denounce the old gods. Baltar declares that people are not being told the truth and begins defacing the temple. Security personnel arrest him before a riot starts.

In Galactica's sick bay, Adama meets Roslin, bringing a novel to read aloud during her cancer treatment. He tells her that he has never finished this particular novel because he enjoys it too much to bear reaching the end.

Down in the brig, Colonel Tigh pays a visit to Caprica Six and asks how she can cope with her guilt in the deaths of billions of human beings. He then hallucinates, seeing his dead wife Ellen Tigh in her place and he fearfully leaves.

On Colonial One, the Quorum meets where Lee Adama challenges President Roslin's latest emergency decree, in response to the religious attacks, which restricts assemblies to twelve people or fewer. Roslin assures him that the decree is aimed squarely at Gaius Baltar and his monotheistic sect, but the other Quorum members argue that the decree could be applied to many polytheistic believers as well, whose beliefs approximate parts of Baltar's religion. An angry Roslin challenges the Quorum to override her decree, while reminding them of what happened when Baltar was President and warning them of what might happen if he were to obtain significant religious influence.

On Galactica, Tyrol returns to work, but remains distracted. He clears Racetrack's Raptor for flight, but the ship soon suffers an explosion and is forced into an emergency crash-landing. Although Racetrack and her ECO Skulls escape injury, the Raptor is destroyed. An inspection reveals that Tyrol failed to swap a damaged part for the replacement he was carrying at the time. Racetrack tries to drop the matter saying that nobody was hurt—&quot;It was human error&quot;—but Tyrol becomes furious and challenges any of the witnesses to face him and say that he &quot;frakked&quot; up.

Distraught over the incident, Tyrol sits alone in Joe's Bar. Adama arrives and tries to console him over the death of Cally; Tyrol hallucinates and hears Adama call Cally a Cylon-lover who birthed a half-breed abomination, but really he had said that Cally was a good person.[1] Tyrol becomes enraged, insulting Cally and denouncing her as second-best. He says that the one who he really loved was Boomer, but she turned out to be a Cylon. Adama insists he heard enough from the Chief and tells him to end his outburst, but Tyrol turns his tirade against Adama himself and the Galactica. Adama dismissed Tyrol from Deck Crew Chief of Galactica with rank demotion to Specialist, then commands him to appear for a duty reassignment the following morning. He leaves a despondent Chief behind at the bar.

Later, Roslin visits Baltar in the brig where she tells him that she doesn't have long to live and warns that her impending death has left her willing to act outside of the law. She threatens Baltar not to disturb the peace and then has him released.

Meanwhile, Colonel Tigh visits Caprica Six once again but he continues to see Ellen in her place. He orders the guards and observation crew away and turns off the surveillance cameras. He then repeats his earlier question of guilt to Six who says that humankind learns from pain and needs pain to achieve clarity, as she has learned from her own pain. She removes Tigh's eye-patch, but after a moment he pushes her away. She responds by savagely beating him down to the floor, but Tigh asks for more. She admits that it appears that she was wrong about his needs and starts to kiss him.

At the sect's quarters, Baltar and several members are barred from entry to their home by a guard at the door who says he is enforcing Roslin's emergency decree against assembly. Head Six appears to Baltar and tells him he will not be harmed if he continues on. Baltar then attempts to pass but is beaten down by the soldier. Bleeding and kneeling on the floor, Baltar whispers that he cannot continue, but Head Six orders him to his feet. She then forcibly pulls him upright and Gaius appears to be physically lifted by an unseen force. The surprised guard again knocks him to the floor. Lee Adama then arrives and declares that the Quorum has overturned Roslin's decree and that the people are free to assemble. In his quarters, Baltar delivers a lengthy speech. He declares that his monotheistic followers contain the spark of God inside them and that they must learn to love themselves before they can begin to love each other.

As the speech continues, the scene briefly moves to the Demetrius, where Starbuck has fallen asleep atop her navigation charts. A concerned Samuel Anders enters the room and stares at her.

Back on Galactica, Baltar concludes by telling his followers that since God loves them, they must therefore be perfect as they are. The followers cheer. Tory Foster stands in the rear of the room. Head Six is next to her, observing her. Lee Adama stands further back, also listening.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6936">The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,676. It is the only episode of the entire series in which Bill Adama does not appear, and the first of two episodes not to feature Laura Roslin. It is also the final episode in which Number Six is absent



Plot

The episode begins aboard Demetrius, now 58 days into the mission to find Earth. Helo reports to Captain Starbuck and reminds her that the time is near to rendezvous back with the fleet. Starbuck concentrates intently on a star chart of a sector Helo states they have explored twice already. She tells him that she has a feeling that the &quot;third time's a charm&quot; and that she will scout the sector herself.

On Galactica, Gaius Baltar continues to preach his monotheistic beliefs. He hears a woman's story of the loss of her family during the Cylon sneak attack and her anger that the Gods stood by and let it happen. Baltar tells her that the Gods didn't aid them because they do not exist and humanity has been pandering to their own ignorance. Meanwhile in his quarters, Galen Tyrol listens to Baltar's rhetoric over a radio while he exercises.

In space, Starbuck and her wingman Hot Dog head out to explore the sector. Soon, DRADIS picks up an incoming Cylon Heavy Raider. Starbuck intercepts the craft which is heavily damaged and spinning out of control. Suddenly, she hears the voice of Leoben Conoy over the communications channel who tells Starbuck that he has found her and it is time to complete her journey. Leoben is brought aboard Demetrius where he tells Starbuck that she needs the help of his fellow Cylons and that she needs to go to the Hybrid; it will give her the answers she seeks. Instead of locking him up, Starbuck has him taken to her quarters.

On Galactica, Tory finds Tyrol standing in the Viper launch tube obsessing about Cally's &quot;accident&quot;. Tory tells him that she was emotionally disturbed, but Tyrol says she would have never left their son Nicholas behind. Tory suggests Cally sensed Tyrol was a Cylon, and was afraid of him. She says whatever the reason, it was part of God's divine plan and speaks of Baltar's preachings. Vexed, Tyrol states she has been spending too much time with Baltar.

On Demetrius, Anders returns from a recon flight and finds Leoben with Starbuck, guiding her hand in painting her mural - his other hand on her hip. Anders furiously rips Leoben away from her and Starbuck protests the intrusion. As the guards take Leoben away, Helo steps in and reminds Starbuck of the months of mind-games that Leoben played on her back on New Caprica, but she argues that Leoben can help find Earth.

Meanwhile, Anders roughs up Leoben and demands to know what he wants from Starbuck. Leoben says he just wants her to understand her destiny, just as Anders himself is looking for his own moment of clarity. Anders pulls a gun but Leoben says if he dies, Starbuck's dream dies with him and explains there won't be a resurrection this time. Leoben informs him of the war among the Cylons, between those who embrace their nature and those who fear it. He proposes an alliance between his faction and the fleet. The hybrid can lead Starbuck to righteousness and together they can find the promised land. Anders scoffs at the notion and leaves.

Afterward, Anders tells the others of Leoben's proposal which causes more animosity amongst the crew who want to return to the fleet. Everyone, including Athena, believes Starbuck is being brainwashed by the Cylon and he will only lead them into a trap. Helo tries to silence any talk of mutiny, but the antagonism grows more intense. Starbuck appears, apparently overhearing the others, and tells Helo to retrieve the navigation computer from Leoben's Raider.

Back on Galactica, Baltar discusses with Tory the effects his movement is having on President Roslin and the Quorum. Although he is attracting more followers, the leaders consider them of little consequence.

Tyrol attends Baltar's next sermon where Colonel Tigh arrives and pulls him aside. Tigh strongly suggests that Tyrol get over Cally and return to duty, but Tyrol takes offense saying it's not as easy for him to bury his dead wife as Tigh had buried Ellen. He also brings up Tigh's continual visits to Caprica Six. Tigh tells him that he is not ashamed of anything he has done. He can live with all of his choices, but Tyrol can't.

On Demetrius, Sergeant Erin Mathias, goes out in a space suit to check for tracking devices on the docked Raider, but the ship suddenly explodes and Mathias is flung into space.

On Galactica, Tyrol attends another sermon by Baltar; as he leaves, Baltar calls out to him – to set their differences aside and take his hand for Cally. Tyrol tells Baltar that Cally may have forgiven him but there are some sins that even God won't forgive. Instead of taking Baltar's hand, Tyrol violently chokes him. Baltar's followers pull Tyrol away while he furiously shouts that Baltar didn't know Cally. Tyrol then enters his quarters and furiously trashes the room. He pulls out a gun and points it at his head shouting in despair. He then tearfully breaks down.

On Demetrius, Starbuck accuses Leoben of blowing up his raider and strikes him bloody. He swears it was a malfunction but then tells Starbuck to finish him off promising he won't be resurrected this time. Starbuck relents and asks what happened the two months she was missing – the visions of her mother she had, what does it all mean? Leoben says she has to make peace with the ghosts of her past as they are obstacles that are keeping her from realizing her destiny. He tells her that he sees her as an angel blazing with God's glory and waiting to lead her people on.

Starbuck meets with her crew to honor Mathias. She blames herself for the loss, but they have to complete the mission. She orders Helo to set course to rendezvous with Leoben's Basestar. When she leaves, Lieutenant Pike refuses to follow Starbuck any further and demands Helo take charge of the situation. Pike refuses to stand down, and Helo knocks him to the deck.

On Galactica, against the warnings of his followers, Baltar pays a visit to Tyrol's quarters. He finds Tyrol lying awake in his bunk with the gun on his hip. Baltar nervously apologizes for his intrusion and says he is truly sorry for Cally's loss. He admits to having done unconscionable crimes but he seems to have been given another chance for redemption and begs Tyrol for forgiveness. As Baltar leaves, Tyrol holds out his hand in friendship and Baltar eagerly accepts it.

On Demetrius Starbuck enters the bridge and issues an order to Helo to prepare for a jump to the coordinates of the Basestar. All eyes fall on Helo as he swallows hard and tells Starbuck he cannot put the crew at risk. Starbuck relieves him and appoints Mr. Gaeta as the new XO, but he also refuses to follow her command. Starbuck narrows her eyes as Helo asserts his authority to relieve her of command.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7265">The episode guest starred actress Nana Visitor, best known for her role as Kira Nerys on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,675.

Plot

The episode begins aboard the Demetrius, as Helo refuses to obey Captain Starbuck's orders to rendezvous with Leoben's Basestar. Starbuck tries to initiate the FTL jump herself but is restrained by Athena. Helo tells Gaeta to initiate the jump to the fleet, but Anders prevents it by shooting Gaeta in the leg. Anders forcefully reminds Helo that Starbuck is still in command.

Horrified by the outcome of the situation, Starbuck finally agrees that taking the Demetrius is too risky and will instead take a Raptor. Anders volunteers to go with her, and Starbuck asks Athena to go as well, hoping she will alert them of any traps. Helo states the Raptor doesn't have enough fuel to return to the fleet, but Starbuck believes she can return with the Basestar. Helo gives her a 15 hour window before he returns to the fleet.

On Colonial One, President Roslin talks with her aide Tory Foster. She commends Tory, who has stepped up with more confidence in her duties and asks her to keep an eye on every issue. Because of her declining health, Roslin is unable to handle every detail herself.

Meanwhile, Starbuck's Raptor jumps to the middle of a Basestar graveyard. As she searches, Starbuck feels close to something and guides the Raptor to the sight of a ringed gas giant with three stars and a comet – the comet being, to Starbuck's astonishment, Leoben's Basestar as it trails vapor behind it. Suddenly, the Raptor is struck by debris and Starbuck is knocked unconscious.

Starbuck awakens, finding herself inside a Basestar hangar bay. While Athena inspects the Raptor, she is approached by several copies of the Number Eight model. One of them tells her that she was the first to realize their kind need not be a slave to their programming. They explain that in their attempt to revolt, the Sixes only led them to disaster and they ask Athena to help lead a mutiny against them. Athena refuses to get involved and admonishes the copies about picking a side and staying with it.

In Galactica's sickbay, Roslin overhears a terminal cancer patient, Emily Kowalski, complaining about her treatment. She finds her listening to Gaius Baltar over the radio, and suggests Emily's treatment would go better if she did not listen to him. Emily suddenly explodes in rage and tells Roslin to go away.

Back on the Basestar, Leoben argues with a Six (Natalie) over allowing Starbuck to see the Hybrid. Starbuck sees no choice in the matter as both sides need to help each other. Athena interfaces with the Cylon computer and informs that the Basestar's FTL is damaged. The system can piggyback off the Raptor's FTL to navigate a jump back to the Demetrius, but the Hybrid will have to be disconnected. After observing Athena's interface, Anders eyes another terminal. He inches his hand toward it covertly, but Starbuck calls his attention elsewhere.

As Anders' associate, Jean Barolay, preps the Raptor for the FTL link up, a copy of Six approaches and recognizes her as a resistance member back on New Caprica. The Six reminds Jean that she had murdered her, unprovoked, in cold blood. When Jean replies that she would be happy to do it again, the Six slams her head into the Raptor door frame. Jean stumbles and collapses, dead. Infuriated, Anders forces the Six to the deck and holds a gun to her head. Starbuck tries to talk Anders down from killing her. The Six known as Natalie asks her sister why she killed Barolay. The Six tells her of an incident on New Caprica when Barolay pushed her into a water treatment reservoir and did nothing but watch her drown, and that she could not get past it. Natalie reaches for the gun and while it is still in Anders' hands, she pulls the trigger herself. Natalie tells a stunned Anders that she gave him what he wanted – &quot;blood for blood&quot;, and with no Resurrection Ship, she says the Six is as dead as his friend.

Back on Galactica, Roslin talks again with Emily who apologizes for her earlier outburst. She tells Roslin that she doesn't agree with Baltar's political stance, but agrees with his religious beliefs saying that she feels a single loving presence from God just as Baltar describes it. She says she had a dream of standing on a ferry boat, crossing the river that Baltar says separates their world from the afterlife. On the shore, she sees her family waiting for her.

On the Basestar, Starbuck sees the Hybrid and listens to her strange rant of technical information and nonsensical statements. Athena and a Number 8 arrive to disconnect the Hybrid; as the Number 8 proceeds to pull the connector, the Hybrid begins to howl. A Centurion guarding the room quickly reacts and shoots the Number 8 in the ensuing confusion. As Kara and Athena disable the Centurion with multiple gunshots, the Hybrid speaks to Starbuck: &quot;The dying leader will know the truth of the opera house. The missing three will give you the five who have come from the home of the thirteenth. You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace. You will lead them all to their end. End of line.&quot; Starbuck stares into the face of the Hybrid, horrified by what she has been told.

On Galactica, Roslin sits with Emily. Roslin explains that Baltar is speaking only of the Cylon God, but Emily believes he is the god of all and argues that the metaphysical stories of the Lords of Kobol are inconceivable. Roslin agrees, stating the Lords are only metaphors. Roslin tearfully harkens back to when her mother was dying and how she believed Aphrodite would take her away, but in the end there was nothing but darkness. Emily says that Roslin was the one who saw only darkness and couldn't possibly know what her mother really experienced.

Back on the Basestar, Natalie tries to solve the Hybrid's riddle saying &quot;the Three&quot; is reference to D'anna and that she knows who the final five Cylons are. The five have come from the 13th tribe and they will know where Earth is. The next step is to unbox D'anna. Now knowing what to do, Starbuck's team and the Cylons prepare to rendezvous with the Demetrius.

On Galactica, Roslin has the dream that Emily described. Seeing herself on a boat with Emily and her loved ones waiting by the shore. Roslin sees her mother standing there for her, but responds that she is &quot;not ready&quot;. She awakens to find that Emily has died.

On Demetrius, the clock has run out and Helo prepares to jump back to the fleet. Suddenly, the Basestar appears right on top of them. Athena calls Helo and tells him they have successfully secured the Basestar.

On Galactica, Roslin talks to Admiral Adama, discussing Emily's shared dream she had. Adama doesn't know what to make of it; his thoughts are set on Lee turning in his wings for a political career, and Starbuck's sudden reappearance from the dead. Knowing the Demetrius is overdue, Adama wonders if he will ever see Starbuck and her crew again. Roslin explains that she is with him now and that they will find Earth. Adama recollects when he only was using the myth of Earth as a carrot for the fleet. Roslin asks why he now believes in Earth, and he replies, smiling, she made him believe.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4416">The title is a reference to the 1967 film Guess Who's Coming To Dinner starring Sidney Poitier. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,673.

Plot

The episode begins moments after the conclusion of the previous episode, &quot;Faith&quot;. The damaged Cylon Basestar has arrived at the same location as the Colonial ship Demetrius. Starbuck and Lt. Athena talk with Capt. Helo, the executive officer of the Demetrius, and remind him that both ships must jump at the same time so that they arrive back at the Colonial Fleet together. If the Cylon basestar arrives alone, the Galactica will attack the damaged basestar and likely destroy it.

The ships jump, but the Demetrius suffers a mechanical error which prevents it from jumping. The basestar arrives in the midst of the Colonial Fleet. Galactica launches its fighters and prepares to fire its weapons at the Cylon vessel. Just as the Galactica is about to fire on the defenseless Cylon vessel, Col. Tigh orders a halt to the attack, surprising Adm. William Adama. Just then, the Demetrius jumps into the battle and Helo communicates with the Galactica, advising the Colonial ship that the basestar is under the control of Capt. Thrace.

Lt. Gaeta, shot in the lower leg by Anders in the previous episode, is quickly taken into surgery aboard the Galactica. His leg is amputated below the right knee, traumatizing him.

Colonial troops board and take control of the Cylon ship. Adm. Adama, President Roslin, Col. Tigh, and presidential aide Tory Foster interview Natalie, one of the Sixes and leader of the rebel Cylons. She tells them of the Cylon civil war and the rebels' desire to find the Final Five Cylons, whom they believe will help them find Earth. Adama and Roslin express disbelief that the Cylon rebels can be trusted, but Natalie offers them proof of her goodwill: The &quot;Final Five,&quot; she says, are somewhere in the human fleet. Natalie offers to take the Galactica to the Hub, which is a nexus of operations for all Cylon &quot;resurrection ships.&quot; If the Hub is destroyed, the resurrection ships will cease to function and all Cylons will become mortal. Natalie tells them that the Hub is also where the deactivated Number Threes known as D'Anna Biers are located, who know the faces of the Final Five. Roslin and Adama agree to the plan.

Roslin, Athena and Caprica-Six once again have their shared dream in which Athena and Roslin chase Athena's half-human, half-Cylon child, Hera Agathon, through the opera house only to have Caprica-Six take the child into a brilliantly-lit auditorium. This time, however, Gaius Baltar is seen waiting at the entrance of the brilliantly lit door, walking away with Six and Hera. When Athena awakens from her dream, she finds Hera by her bedside. Hera whispers, &quot;Bye-bye.&quot;

Starbuck visits Roslin and tells her that the Cylon Hybrid prophesied &quot;the dying leader shall know the truth of the opera house&quot;. A startled Roslin asks for Thrace's help in unraveling the meaning of her vision, and Thrace agrees to do so.

Natalie is brought in to meet the Quorum. She tells the Quorum that the Cylon rebels have realized that death is an important part of life. The Cylons have begun to cherish every moment of the life, now that they realize they might permanently die. They no longer wish to engage in war, but need humanity's help to not only help them find Earth but also bring this realization to all Cylons everywhere. The stratagem seems to work, and Roslin gets the support of the Quorum.

Lt. Sharon Agathon arrives home in her quarters aboard the Galactica to find her daughter, Hera, coloring in a book. When she looks at the book, it's filled with childish drawings of the Cylon Six model and the number six repeated over and over. Athena looks up to find Hera gone. She runs through the ship, trying to find her daughter. In a corridor, Hera meets Natalie, who's being escorted by several Colonial Marines. Hera stops and Natalie kneels to greet the child. Athena rushes up and pulls a gun on Natalie. She announces Natalie will not take her child. Natalie says she does not want the child, but Athena shoots her twice and Natalie appears to die.

Aboard the Cylon basestar, Roslin, Baltar, and the leader of the Eights arrive in the Hybrid's room. Roslin orders the Hybrid reconnected to the Basestar's systems. As soon as the Hybrid wakes up, it screams &quot;Jump!&quot; The Basestar then jumps away from the Fleet.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3116">The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,674



Plot

The episode continues from the previous episode &quot;Guess What's Coming to Dinner?&quot; with the mortally injured Cylon Natalie being taken to the sickbay. After seeing visions of green trees, she dies. President Laura Roslin visits the Basestar accompanied by half of the pilots. After the hybrid is plugged in, the Basestar immediately jumps away to unknown coordinates. The Quorum must find a replacement for Roslin, who is assumed kidnapped. The Quorum can elect a temporary president, so Lee Adama solicits the help of a reluctant Romo Lampkin in choosing the best candidate.

Admiral Adama questions Lt. Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon in his quarters regarding why she shot Natalie. Athena confesses to Adama about the visions she had of Natalie and Gaius Baltar taking away her half-human, half-Cylon child, Hera. She is sent to the brig.

Admiral Adama must now both protect the fleet and find the rebel Basestar with Roslin and his troops on board. He orders Colonel Saul Tigh to interrogate Caprica-Six in the brig to try to get information from her about the Cylon hub. Tigh's interrogation/liaison is interrupted when a badly damaged missing Raptor jumps into contact range. The raptor's flight data recorder shows where its jump had originated. A raptor scouting mission to those coordinates finds the remains of a battle with a destroyed Cylon Basestar, Viper and what is assumed to be the hub. Adama does not believe the destroyed Basestar was the rebels' ship with Roslin on board, and he orders 4 raptors to remain there in case it returns.

Admiral Adama meets with Colonel Tigh in his cabin and confronts him with the information that he knows about Tigh's “meetings” with Caprica-Six in the brig with the cameras turned off. Adama reveals to Tigh that Caprica-Six is pregnant. Tigh, in shock, does not deny that he is the father; Adama accuses him of betrayal. Tigh in turn accuses Adama of risking the whole fleet by searching for Roslin. Angers explode and a short but brutal fight ensues between the two men, but the old friends soon stop and accept their unusual emotional predicaments.

All the names on the list of potential presidential candidates have been eliminated, but Lampkin realizes that there is only one name who could possibly replace Roslin even if it was not on the list. After finding Lee, Romo congratulates him on his successful candidacy, but Lee explains he was never a candidate. Lampkin does not listen and pulls a gun on him. Lampkin is distraught because he lost his wife during the attack on the colonies and does not believe humanity deserves to have a president who gives such hope as Lee would. Lee Adama convinces Lampkin that there is hope and that he will make a difference. Lee is sworn in as acting President.

Admiral Adama will no longer risk his remaining pilots or the fleet in looking for Roslin, and hands over command of the Galactica to Tigh. The Admiral takes a Raptor and remains behind. While he waits, he reads the charred copy of Searider Falcon which was recovered from the damaged Raptor</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2991">The episode continues from &quot;Revelations&quot;, where both the colonial fleet and the rebel Cylons finally found Earth, only to find it devastated by a nuclear holocaust at least 2,000 years before, and the discovery leads to despair all across the fleet. The episode was not given an opening title sequence, but the survivor count for the episode was 39,651

'''Plot:'''

Both the Human fleet and the rebel Cylons are disillusioned after finding Earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust, which occurred at least 2,000 years prior to the events of the episode. After research on the bodies found in the soil, the Cylons and Dr. Baltar conclude that the remains are not Human, but Cylon in origin. The rebel Cylons further state that the mechanical Cylon remains resemble older Centurions of theirs but are of a kind unknown to them. Following this, they speculate that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted of a different kind of Cylon which existed over 2,000 years ago and moved out from Kobol to populate Earth. When addressing the fleet, Admiral Adama never states this fact, leaving the fleet in the belief that the Thirteenth Tribe was human. Meanwhile, Samuel Anders, Galen Tyrol and Tory Foster receive short memories of their lives on Earth 2,000 years ago. Kara Thrace has Leoben help track the origins of the beacon. However, what they find is a crashed viper, with a corpse with Starbuck's dog tags. After Kara recites what the Hybrid has told her, Leoben becomes scared and retreats, with Thrace wondering what she is. In shock, Thrace takes the body and burns it on a pyre, and decides to not tell anyone about what she found, making people believe she lost the signal.

In the fleet, President Roslin burns her book of Pythia, and is unable to address the fleet because of feeling that she led the fleet nowhere, and believing the prophecy is a lost cause. Lee Adama and Anastasia Dualla revisit their relationship, and after their evening together, Dualla returns to her quarters, and commits suicide. Devastated by this, Admiral Adama acquires a handgun from a Marine and attempts to coerce Tigh into killing him, which fails. Adama breaks down relieved and converses with Tigh about past memories, and Tigh reminding Adama of his duties as commander of the fleet. Adama eventually steps back into the CIC, and makes an announcement that he will find a home for the fleet, gives instructions to search for any nearby habitable star systems, and invites their new Cylon allies to join them. As the fleet prepares to leave Earth, D'Anna, devastated by the knowledge that history repeats itself endlessly, decides to remain on Earth to die, rather than being hunted by Cavil. Tigh walks into the sea and receives a flashback of his life on Earth. He realizes that his wife, Ellen, is the last of the Final Five Cylons. In the vision, a dying Ellen tells Tigh that &quot;everything is in place&quot; and that they will be &quot;reborn, again, together&quot;. They are destroyed in this vision by a nuclear blast.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6580">The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,644. The Region 1 DVD release of Season 4.5 includes an extended version of this episode

Plot

The episode begins by following William Adama through his morning routine. He appears very distressed and discontented and later makes his way to the CIC in a disgruntled mood.

In sickbay, Saul Tigh and the Six impregnated by him watch their baby on an ultrasound medical imaging device. Six mentions that previously, intra-Cylon procreation has never been successful, and that this baby is the savior of the Cylon race, since it means survival without resurrection ships. Meanwhile, Felix Gaeta waits to be treated, and complains about how the Cylons don't have to wait and are getting better treatment than he is.

On Colonial One, a presidential press conference is held to address the current situation with Earth and the fleet's upcoming plans. The press seems to be concerned about rumors of the alliance with the rebel Cylons, and multiple questions regarding this situation are being asked, as well as whether the Cylons Saul Tigh, Galen Tyrol and Samuel Anders are going to continue serving in the fleet, and whether the identity of the last Cylon is finally known, to none of which Admiral Adama, Lee Adama nor nominated vice president and current acting president Tom Zarek give a definite answer. Lee slips up and mentions that the final Cylon was female, revealing to the reporters that more is known than is being said.

After the press conference, William Adama and his son, Lee Adama argue with Tom Zarek, who opposes the planned official alliance with the Cylons, stating that in the time that he is the acting president, such an alliance will not happen.

William Adama, Saul Tigh, Lee Adama, Galen Tyrol, Felix Gaeta and Karl Agathon meet in the Admiral's office to confer about upgrading the fleet's jump drives, an upgrade which would triple the fleet's chances of finding a habitable planet. For the upgrades to happen, though, the fleet's citizens and captains of the ships would have to be willing to let Cylons do the upgrades. In turn for upgrading the drives, the Cylons request that they be allowed to become citizens of the fleet. By becoming citizens, they hope to make Adama oath-bound to protect them from Cavil's faction of the Cylons. Felix Gaeta objects to the idea.

Galen Tyrol brings his son into sickbay where, after an examination, Dr. Cottle states that the child is suffering from renal failure. After the question of blood transfusions comes up and Tyrol remarks that the child would need his blood since it is half-Cylon, Dr. Cottle reveals to Tyrol that the child is not his, withholding the father's identity. Tyrol leaves visibly upset and disappointed.

Felix Gaeta confronts Kara Thrace in the messhall, accusing her husband Samuel Anders, now known to be a Cylon, of having helped to murder billions of people, and he accuses her of possibly being a Cylon too. Felix states that a reckoning will happen soon, referring to Captain Thrace accusing him once of being a collaborator and wanting to throw him out the airlock, and when she asks whether this is a threat, Gaeta confirms it. Kara finally retreats. Gaeta gathers the others in, to introduce them to his plans.

In a Quorum meeting, Tom Zarek is making a point about how collaborating with the Cylons, the original enemy of the 12 colonies, is a complete mistake, and he claims that President Roslin and Admiral Adama are proposing this only to stay in power. Following that, he makes a proposal that Cylons should only be allowed to board ships in the fleet with the crew's permission. The Quorum votes unanimously with the exception of Lee Adama for the proposal, thus accepting it.

Laura Roslin refuses to stay in office as president throughout the entire episode. She throws away her cancer-fighting medication and starts jogging around the ship's corridors. There, she meets Admiral Adama, who tries to convince her that she is needed right now and must step back into office, to which she replies that she does not want to be used in any kind of plan anymore and does not want to play any role, and that she deserves to live, after all that has happened. Adama grudgingly agrees, and Roslin tells him that he deserves to live a little as well. She kisses him and leaves.

In a lower deck, Gaius Baltar speaks before to a gathering. He states that they should not have to excuse themselves before God, but that God should come down and beg for their forgiveness, since not they have sinned, but he led them to the desperate situation they are in now.

Galen Tyrol is present during Baltar's speech, and he sees Hot Dog, a Viper pilot, there as well. The two exchange long, intense stares, and Galen realizes that Hot Dog is the father of Specialist Cally Henderson Tyrol's child, a fact which Hot Dog admits when Tyrol approaches and confronts him. Tyrol punches him, and they engage in an intense fistfight in the middle of Baltar's speech. Tyrol later brings Hot Dog into sickbay, both of them sporting fresh bruises, telling him that it is now his turn to watch the child.

The fleet's tylium ship, the Hitei Kan, defects, making an FTL jump to coordinates unknown to the rest of the fleet with the exception of Tom Zarek, who instructed the tylium ship to do so. After the ship leaves, William Adama has Tom Zarek arrested and blackmails him into revealing the location of the ship with alleged information of criminal acts of Zarek's during his time as politician. Zarek gives in and reveals the location of the ship to Adama. When Adama later hands the dossier to Tigh for him to give it to Mr. Hoshi, it becomes apparent that he was only bluffing, as the dossier was composed of laundry reports.

In the aftermath, Felix Gaeta meets with Tom Zarek. Tom Zarek promises that there will be consequences to what has happened, and Felix Gaeta agrees, stating that in his opinion everything is going wrong, and that there has to be someone to make it right again. He asks Zarek whether he is that man. Zarek replies that he is one of them, but that he needs a partner. Gaeta states that as of now, he has one, and shakes hands with Zarek.

Sharon Agathon and other crew jump to the tylium ship's coordinates, and manage to bring it back. Admiral Adama receives notification of the tylium ship's return, accepting the call while being in his quarters, in bed with Laura Roslin. She shows some interest in the news, and he asks her if she now cares. She responds in the negative, and hangs up the phone, and he laughs.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2771">In the previous episode, the fleet's leadership announced its plan to upgrade the fleet's jump drives using Cylon technology to triple its reach in searching for a final home. Felix Gaeta, betrayed by Cylons on several occasions, vehemently opposes the plan. Finally, he makes a pact with Tom Zarek, as of then not fully disclosed, to, in his words, rectify things that have gone wrong. The episode has a survivor count of 39,643

Plot

Gaeta helps Zarek to jailbreak from the Galactica onto Colonial One. There, Zarek talks Lee Adama into leaving Colonial One and returning to Galactica, to request from Admiral Adama the reason for letting Zarek go. In the meantime, Gaeta organizes a full scale mutiny onboard Galactica, with the civilians arming themselves using weapons from Galactica's weapons lockers. Kara Thrace notices the uprising, and tries to get confirmation on what is happening, but is denied the information, being repelled on the grounds of her status being unknown after the events of Sometimes a Great Notion. Officers of the fleet who have mutinied, among them prominent people like Racetrack, Narcho and Skulls, take Lee Adama hostage upon arrival on the Galactica. He is promptly rescued by Thrace. They flee together, and decide to try to remedy the situation to whatever extent is in their reach.

Rebel crew imprison Samuel Anders, as well as Karl Agathon and his wife Sharon Agathon, and their child, Hera Agathon, together with Caprica Six in a brig cell. In the CIC, Admiral Adama and Saul Tigh are taken hostage and sent to the brig as well. Adama and Tigh manage to overwhelm their captors and break free. Lee Adama and Capt. Thrace help President Laura Roslin (who has decided to take an active role in government again) meet with Gaius Baltar in order for her to use Baltar's wireless transmitter to address the fleet and bring the people back into order; afterwards they join up by coincidence with Admiral Adama and Tigh. Together they make their way to Storage Bay Two, from where Galen Tyrol has promised to take the Admiral and the President into safety onto the rebel Cylon basestar.

Zarek keeps control of the situation from Colonial One. His intentions were, as it turns out, to have Admiral Adama killed, and he is dissatisfied that this didn't happen.

Alone in the storage bay, Baltar and Roslin come back closer together. They realize that they finally have more in common than it seemed all along. Roslin finally makes it off the Galactica with Tyrol's help; Gaeta however orders their Raptor to be destroyed. Saul Tigh and Admiral Adama defend the storage bay from where the Raptor took off, only to be attacked by rebel marines. Both Tigh and Adama's as well as the Raptor's fate remain uncertain at the end of the episode</text>

Plot

Felix Gaeta and Tom Zarek move to consolidate their insurrection in the fleet, while Cpt. Kara Thrace and Lee Adama organize resistance on board the Galactica and try to retake control of the ship. Zarek brings in Romo Lampkin to serve as Admiral Adama's defense counsel, against both Lampkin's and Adama's will. After a brief trial, Zarek, acting as judge, condemns Adama to death by firing squad. Zarek travels to Colonial One to attempt to solidify his position with the support of the Quorum of Twelve (absent Lee Adama). When they reject his coup and ask him to leave, he has two marines execute the entire group. Meanwhile, Kara and Lee rescue the high-profile prisoners taken in &quot;The Oath&quot; (Samuel Anders, Colonel Tigh, Sharon Agathon, as well as Helo, Hera and Caprica-Six), and with the help of Aaron Kelly rescue Admiral Adama from execution. Laura Roslin and her allies on the Cylon basestar, now under threat of attack from Gaeta and the Galactica, position the ship among the fleet to temporarily shield themselves. With Adama certain to be killed, the Cylons vote to jump away, but Roslin convinces them to stay with the fleet.

Adama and his allies, including some former rebels, march to retake the CIC. During a skirmish, Anders is shot in the neck, and Kara convinces Romo Lampkin to help her carry him to Dr. Cottle. In the CIC, Gaeta and Zarek are in the middle of a standoff with President Roslin. Zarek lies that Adama has already been killed, and Roslin vows to take vengeance. Gaeta orders the ship to jump away, but Tyrol has sabotaged the FTL drive, and Gaeta realizes the mutiny is failing. Adama and his men storm the CIC and the mutineers give up without a fight. After the CIC is reclaimed, Tyrol, who is still in the engine room, notices and inspects a heavily damaged section of wall. Long linear grooves appear to have been gouged into the steel. It is unclear what caused this damage.

Gaeta has a final conversation with Gaius Baltar before being executed. Gaeta and Zarek are executed for their actions by a firing squad, but moments before, Gaeta realizes the phantom pains in his amputated leg have finally stopped.</text>

Plot summary

Ellen Tigh and Boomer arrive at the fleet and Boomer is immediately taken to the brig. Ellen and Saul reunite and, after making love, go together to visit Sam Anders, who is still comatose. Tory Foster, Galen Tyrol, a Six and an Eight are also by Anders' bedside. The Cylons propose that since Ellen has returned, they should leave the human fleet, especially since Caprica Six is pregnant with Saul's fully Cylon child and they no longer need humans in order to reproduce. Ellen did not know about Caprica Six being pregnant, and is angry at Saul as she was never able to conceive children, and Caprica could only have become pregnant if he truly loved her. Furthermore, because the other Cylons are the Final Five's creations, she views Saul's relationship with Caprica in an incestuous light.

A vote is had by the Final Five on whether they should stay with the human fleet, and they promise to be bound by the results of that vote. Tory Foster and Galen Tyrol vote they go, Saul Tigh votes they stay and they assume from what Anders has said previously he would also vote to stay, which leaves Ellen with the deciding vote. She states that she needs more time, and goes to visit Caprica Six in her quarters. She &quot;accidentally&quot; tells Caprica Six that she and Saul had sex, before telling her she believed Saul loved Caprica more than he loved her. Ellen then calls another meeting, and says she has decided that the Cylon fleet should leave. Saul refuses to leave, and Ellen says this is because he loves the ship and William Adama more than herself or Caprica Six. Caprica becomes upset and starts to lose the baby. He and Ellen unite to try to tell Caprica that Saul does love her which Ellen believes will save the baby, but Caprica Six still suffers a miscarriage. Saul goes to Adama for support, revealing that the baby's name was &quot;Liam&quot;, short for William. (Writer Jane Espenson confirmed that Saul wanted to name his child after his best friend.

Elsewhere, Tyrol and teams of Cylons attempt to fix the ship by using a Cylon polymer to grow into the cracks. Gaius Baltar rejoins his believers, who have taken up arms in order to get and keep supplies, but gives some away to starving people in &quot;Dogsville&quot; before the rest is stolen by the Sons of Ares. He appeals to Admiral Adama, who supplies him with weapons to prevent it happening in the future. Near the end of the episode, the monitor near Anders indicates that he has higher brain functions and his eyes flutter as in REM sleep. The episode ends with Roslin and Adama walking through the ship past a Six and an Eight working on the ship's hull and a group of mixed human and Cylon pilots. A Six has stopped in front of the Wall, staring at the photos, and Roslin realises that the Cylons have begun memorialising their dead there in the same way as the humans</text>

Plot

Kara Thrace is depressed that her husband, Samuel Anders, is still in a coma, with little good news from Dr. Cottle concerning his condition. She has returned to a bleak daily routine after the events of her leading the fleet to Earth, when she had felt special, as if she had a purpose and knew what she was doing for the first time in her life. She is also plagued by nightmares of the body that was presumably her own, crashed on Earth.

Thrace makes friends with the bar's piano player, and slowly reveals to him that her father used to play the piano too. During the process, she discusses her childhood and her feelings towards her father, who left the family and never contacted her or her mother again, much as the piano player did with his own family. Thrace assists the piano player with writing a new song. Eventually, he convinces a reluctant Thrace to play the piano too. The piano player shows affection towards Starbuck much in the same way her father did. Together they play a song she faintly remembers from her childhood, and eventually she realizes a drawing given to her earlier by Hera Agathon is not a drawing of stars, as Hera said, but a sequence of musical notes that matches the song from her memory.

Together, Thrace and the piano player reconstruct the song, which turns out to be the music the four of the Final Five present on Galactica heard throughout the events of Crossroads Pt. II. Saul Tigh, Ellen Tigh, and Tory Foster, who were all lingering in the bar while Thrace and the piano player were reconstructing the song, confront her about the song's origin, to which she replies that she used to play it as a child with her father. When Kara turns to the piano player, he has vanished.

In the meantime, Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii is about to be extradited by the Colonial fleet to the rebel Cylons, who plan to try her for treason for siding with Cavil. They seek the death penalty; now that there is no Cylon resurrection available anymore, death would be permanent. Boomer tricks Galen Tyrol into helping her to leave the Galactica by claiming that she still sees a future for them together. Through Cylon mental projection, she shows Tyrol a home she has &quot;constructed&quot; for them both, including their child.

She beats Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon and ties her up, putting her in a closet, just before Karl &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon walks in on them. She has sex with him, while the tied up Athena watches through an opening, gagged and unable to speak. She then kidnaps Hera, escapes by stealing a Raptor, and causes damage to the Galactica by performing an FTL jump too close to the ship. The episode ends with Tyrol's devastation after realizing that Boomer tricked him and he has unwittingly helped her kidnap Hera.</text>

&quot;Islanded in a Stream of Stars&quot; is the twentieth episode in the fourth season of the reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica''.

With Hera now likely in the hands of John Cavil, Admiral Adama sends out search teams to locate The Colony, the Cylon home world, that Ellen Tigh says is the only place she imagines she could be. Adama reluctantly comes to the conclusion that the Galactica has reached the end of its days. He orders all repair activities halted and decides to strip the ship and share everything that is salvageable with the rest of the fleet. Starbuck meanwhile shares with Gaius Baltar what she found on the uninhabitable Earth. He subsequently - and quite publicly - proclaims her to be an angel.

== Synopsis ==

The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,521

Repairs on Galactica continue, but it seems little headway is being made. The ship's systems are fluctuating, and a major hull breach kills 61 people, 26 of them Cylons.

Ellen Tigh states that if Cavil's plan is to study Hera and learn what made her a successful human-Cylon hybrid, he would take her to &quot;The Colony&quot;, which is a large biomechanical structure similar in composition to the Basestars (after the armistice, the Final Five and the Centurions retreated to this &quot;home&quot;). Under protest, Adama allows a heavy raider to be sent to The Colony, not wanting to risk the whole fleet. In their room, Helo and Athena are distraught over the kidnapping of their daughter. Helo asks Adama for a Raptor so that he can go look for Hera, but Adama tells him that the Cylons have already reported back that the Colony has moved.

As Boomer plots several jumps to the Colony in order to deliver Hera to Cavil, Hera begins to whine and cry for her mother. Boomer grabs a needle with a sedative in it and threatens Hera with it, but finds herself unwilling to forcibly sedate her. Boomer begins to tell Hera about her dream home with Tyrol on Picon, revealing that it was, in fact, once her dream and not simply a ruse created to manipulate Galen Tyrol. Hera reaches for Boomer's hand and connects with her, allowing the little girl to project the dwelling in Boomer's imagination. This is a welcome surprise for Boomer as she knew not whether Hera, who is half Cylon and half human, possessed this ability. Boomer arrives at The Colony with Hera and delivers her to Cavil. Hera becomes upset when she is handed over, and Boomer also seems reluctant to give her up.

Gaius Baltar meets Kara Thrace in one of the ship's heads, where Kara tells him that she discovered her own body on Earth and asks him to analyze her dog tags. Baltar finds blood on the tag that came from a body which was already dead whose DNA matches Starbuck's. At the burial of those lost in the hull breach, Baltar reveals what he has discovered and designates Starbuck an angel. Admiral Adama yells at him to be quiet, and Starbuck slaps him across the face. Later, Apollo meets with Starbuck and offers her his unconditional love and support. Starbuck puts a photo of herself on the memorial wall of the dead.

Samuel Anders has been transferred to a hybrid tank in the hopes it would help him recover, but he remains comatose. Kara visits him and decides to shoot him as an act of mercy, but the still-comatose Sam grabs the gun and begins to speak like the hybrid. Arriving in Anders' room, Tigh is informed that Anders has gotten into the ship's programming. The Cylon biopolymer fluid which repair crews have painted upon Galactica's hull has made possible a connection between Anders' hybrid tank and Galactica's electrical systems. When the Eight states that it is theoretically possible for Anders to gain control of Galactica's FTL drive and jump away, Tigh orders that he be taken offline. Kara visits Sam and says they will work out the meaning of the song (&quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;) together. She plugs Sam back in and he says, &quot;new command&quot;.

Adama informs Tigh that he has made a decision: he plans to abandon the ship. Adama orders a stop to the repairs on the ship, and he instructs the crew to begin stripping down Galactica, start offloading civilians, and transfer the crew and weapons to the basestar. When Tigh objects, Adama states that the ship is dying and wants to send her off &quot;in style&quot;. Adama and Tigh both salute the damaged Galactica with a drink as the episode ends.

== Continuity ==

*This episode is the first to show repairs to the outer hull of Galactica. As with the earlier repairs to the Space Park, scaffolding, support Raptors and repair crewmen in space suits are seen trying to patch the breach. Presumably this is not the first time Galactica has undergone makeshift repairs given the pounding she has taken. However, this time the endemic damage to the hull makes the repairs much more challenging.

*[[Caprica-Six]] appears to complete her hospitalization from her miscarriage. In the Teaser, she is sleeping in sick bay and sharing her recurring dream with [[Laura Roslin]]. By Act 1, she appears to have been discharged when she meets with Baltar and tells him about her dream.

*Roslin and Caprica Six have resumed their shared recurring dream of [[Hera Agathon]] lost in the [[Opera House]]. During a conversation in &quot;[[Deadlock]]&quot;, they discovered that neither had had the dream since Six's pregnancy began.

*When [[Caprica-Six]] is at [[Gaius Baltar]]'s congregation he spoke to her about hearing about her living arrangement and offered a place to stay. From this it seems that after her miscarriage, she and Saul Tigh have broken up as a couple. As a side effect, Col. Tigh has reverted to his &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; attitude toward Cylons as a whole despite himself and his wife being Cylons including an increase of anti-Cylon &quot;racial&quot; slurs.

*Chief Tyrol is nowhere to be seen in this episode. Even crewman Dealino gives a report to both Admiral Adama and Colonel Tigh of what the attitudes of the Cylons, particularly the Leobens, thought as to how many jumps Galactica has left in her.

*Hera demonstrates the ability to project, which surprises Boomer.
*It is possible that the opening shot of the episode is a projection of Hera's. If so, it is also possible that Hera's projections are prophetic in nature. Her movement of the basestar and Galactica models foreshadows the events of &quot;Daybreak&quot;.

*In sickbay, Adama and Roslin reminisce about [[New Caprica]] and about the cabin they wanted to build but can't. This scene is in its own way similar to the scene in which Boomer and Tyrol share a projection of the house they had intended to build on Picon. As humans, Adama and Roslin can only conjure up fond memories and regrets in their own mind's eyes. Both couples know that it is never to be, building their dream houses.

*Helo wants Athena to say that she hates him because he saw it in her eyes. She almost does. In a close up of her lips her mouth parts slightly, but then closes. This is most likely for him sleeping with Boomer, who subsequently took Hera. Athena probably understands that Helo couldn't prevent the kidnapping, but she probably feels that he should had known that it was not Athena he was sleeping with. It is, however, conceivable she could blame him for the taking of Hera if she thinks that if he realized that it wasn't her he could have had Boomer captured even before she got near Hera.

*In the episode we see what is essentially the Cylon homeworld. [[Ellen Tigh]] explains in a meeting with Admiral Adama, Lee Adama, Tory Foster, Saul Tigh, and Kara Thrace where the Cylons (including the Final Five) were for the past 40 years: &quot;I guess you can call it home. It's where we and the Centurions went after the First War once we convinced them to abandon their own experiments with evolution in exchange for resurrection technology.&quot; In the show's timeline Cavil's faction moved the Colony to its present location five months ago just prior to the Cylon Civil War. It is a huge space station built with the same biological design principles as the baseships.

*Adama's heavy drinking, pill-popping and unprofessional behavior over the last few episodes seems to recall [[Romo Lampkin]]'s comment that &quot;the soldier in him has had enough&quot; in [[The Son Also Rises]].

*Galactica, nicknamed the Bucket, suffers a severe hull breach at the beginning of the episode. Among the &quot;random&quot; phrases hybrid-Anders spouts are the lyrics of the Earth folk song &quot;There's a Hole in My Bucket&quot;. Helo tells Adama that he is &quot;painting over the holes in this bucket.&quot;

*&quot;There's a Hole in My Bucket&quot; is an example of an infinite loop. After several verses describing the intermediate steps required to fix the bucket, it is ultimately revealed that the initial problem--the hole--may only be resolved by gathering water in the self-same bucket. In other words, all this has happened before, and will happen again.

*A corpse produces &quot;death enzymes&quot; as it decomposes. It's likely Baltar found high concentrations of these enzymes on Starbuck's dogtags.

*This episode specifically highlights the existence of 'angels' that walk amongst the humans. Baltar may be referring to his Virtual-Six, but it applies to Caprica-Six's own Virtual-Baltar and the other unseen characters that have appeared throughout the show as well. Another interesting fact to note is that the First Hybrid's prophecy before his death was how the humans and Cylons will be gathered in the arms of an angel and carried into the promised land.

*Kara Thrace is called an angel by Baltar during his declaration of eternal life after he examined Thrace's dogtag. She has also been referred or linked to the Goddess Aurora, who guides ships to safe harbors and who resembles what is typically thought of as 'angels.' Thrace's other title from the Hybrids as the &quot;harbinger of death&quot; may be another spin on her 'angelic' nature; the manifestations of angels in modern day world religions are considered to be signs of the end times.

*This episode establishes that Final Five Cylons can interface with the datastream. Thus, if Anders had placed his hand on the Cylon data-font in the episode &quot;Faith&quot;, it would have responded to him.

*Cottle says the accident caused 61 deaths or injuries, including 26 Cylons. The difference of 35 Colonials would account for the updated survivor total, meaning the only survivors with injuries would be Cylons.
== Body count ==

*35 humans when the hull was breached

*26 cylons when the hull was breached, one being a Number Six

== Other scenes ==

*A deleted scene included in the extended DVD cut shows Starbuck and Helo getting drunk at Joe's Bar, and Starbuck ruminating on her destiny as the Harbinger of Death. She says finding nuked Earth pretty much fulfilled that part of the plan and she wonders what her purpose is now. Helo suggests other meanings for Harbinger, such as herald, to suggest her destiny could be positive. This scene foreshadows Starbuck's use of the music to find the second Earth in &quot;Daybreak,&quot; and implies her role in leading the human race to its end refers to finding the planet where human and Cylon can live a blended existence.

*An extended DVD version of the episode contains a scene in which Athena visits Tyrol in the brig. She tells him that she has Boomer's memories from before the war, that it's ironic Boomer posed as Athena to seduce Helo since Athena posed as Boomer to do the same thing, that Boomer loved the Chief and betraying him like that must have been tough, that she respects Tyrol for turning himself in after realizing he had been duped, and that she will never forgive Tyrol for letting Boomer escape.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3118">The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 1 is 39,516. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 2 is 39,406. At the end of Part 2, Admiral Adama announces the survivor population at approximately 38,000

The episodes portray the Galactica launching a rescue mission to retrieve Hera Agathon from the &quot;colony&quot;, a heavily armed and defended Cylon base located near a black hole. They manage to rescue Hera, and in the end, the fleet finds a new planet to settle on, which they come to call Earth (revealed to be our Earth). The final episodes gave Battlestar Galactica the strongest ratings since its second season, though they received mixed reviews

Plot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 1&lt;br /&gt;
The Galactica crew members and civilians divide themselves between those joining the rescue attempt, and those staying behind with the fleet.

The flashback sequences during the course of the first part take place a few years before the Cylon attack on Caprica. William Adama (Edward James Olmos) is reluctant to undergo a lie detector test in preparation for a civilian desk job. Elsewhere, Gaius Baltar (James Callis) is getting tired of his father, Julian, who is abusive to his nurse. However, Caprica Six (Tricia Helfer) soon informs Baltar that she took his father into a care home, where he will be happier. Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) is living happily with her two sisters, one of whom is pregnant. But later, Roslin receives distressing news that both her sisters and father were killed in a car accident. Three months after, she is set up for a blind date and is encouraged to join Mayor Adar's presidential campaign. Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) meets Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) for the first time while she is seeing his brother, Zak (Tobias Mehler). When Lee arrives home drunk, he notices a pigeon in his house, and he chases it away. Lastly, the flashbacks focus on Anders (Michael Trucco), who is interviewed during his sporting career, where he admits to playing for the joy of the pursuit of perfection rather than the winning.

Back in the present, Galactica is being stripped for parts to be used on other ships, while the military will be transferred to control the Rebel Basestar. The pictures of the fallen in the memorial hallway are also taken down. Baltar wants his people to have a seat on the quorum, but Lee refuses. Admiral Adama later decides to give amnesty to those who took part in the attempted coup d'état,[2] as well as to Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), who is in the brig for helping Boomer (Grace Park) escape.[3] This allows Tyrol to take part in the mission to retrieve Hera (Iliana Gomez-Martinez), who is being studied by the Cylons to determine how Cylons can reproduce. However, Adama doesn't allow Cottle (Donnelly Rhodes) to join in, as he says that the fleet cannot afford to lose a doctor. Several others join in the operation, including the original Cylon models, and a weakened Roslin. A Raptor is dispatched to the possible location of the &quot;Colony&quot;, only to find it located very close to a black hole, but despite the circumstance, Adama orders an attack to begin.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7357">Part 2

In flashback sequences, William Adama and Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) celebrate their upcoming retirement, where Tigh convinces Adama to take his new job. Later, as Adama is questioned in an interview, he complains that no job is worth questioning his loyalty and decides to rejoin the military. Lee has dinner with Zak and Starbuck again. When Zak passes out, drunk, the sexual tension between Kara and Lee nearly erupts before they are interrupted by a stirring Zak. Back home, Lee again encounters the pigeon, but this time he does not chase it. Roslin meets her blind date, who happens to be a former student of hers. After they go back to her apartment, she has second thoughts and ends the date; she then calls Adar's campaign, informing them of her intention to join it. Boomer meets Adama and Tigh for the first time, where she is warned that she is on the verge of ending her career due to her inability to land a Raptor. Given one last chance, Boomer gratefully tells the two that unlike other pilots, she will repay Adama one day. Meanwhile, Baltar, believing that Caprica Six is a corporate spy, allows her access to the military defense mainframe. He says that he is not doing this for her employers, but for her.

Back in the present of the series, Baltar decides to join the mission with Caprica Six at the last minute; she later admits to being proud of him for the first time. It is later revealed that Baltar's Inner Six, and Six's Inner Baltar are aware of each other, and the two real-life counterparts can see both of them. Romo Lampkin (Mark Sheppard) becomes the new president, and Hoshi (Brad Dryborough) is given command of the fleet while Adama and Galactica set off to rescue Hera. Galactica jumps right next to the colony, where they are immediately fired upon. Some of the Raptors, which are armed with nuclear weapons, make a short jump into the debris field and fly toward the back of the colony; in the process, Racetrack (Leah Cairns) and Skulls (Collin Lawrence) are killed by an asteroid. Anders has been installed into the CIC computers, and disables the Hybrids (Tiffany Lyndall-Knight). Galactica rams straight into the colony, where a strike team led by Starbuck searches for Hera. Hera is rescued by Boomer, who kills Simon (Rick Worthy) and finds Starbuck's team. Boomer hands Hera over to Athena (Grace Park) and tells her to, &quot;tell the Admiral I owed him one.&quot; After her daughter is returned, Athena kills Boomer.

However, after Hera is returned, Galactica must also contend with numerous Cylon boarding parties. Hera is split off from her parents. She is spotted by Roslin, who takes a break from assisting with a triage, and is able to hide her from the Cylons, until she disappears again. While Roslin gives chase, Baltar and Caprica also spot Hera and give chase as well. The chase parallels the Opera House vision shared between Athena, Roslin and Caprica.[4] The chase ends in the CIC, where Cavil (Dean Stockwell) holds her hostage. Inner Six and Inner Baltar again appear jointly to Baltar, inspiring him to make a speech saying, among other things, that he sees angels[5] and convincing Cavil to end the war. The Cylon representatives agree that Cavil will give Hera back and let them leave if the Final Five give Cavil the technology for resurrection.

The Final Five begin the download of the technology for resurrection, with Saul and Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon), Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) dipping their hands into Samuel Anders' (Michael Trucco) amniotic fluid to transfer the data to the Colony. But as they download the info, they can see each other's memories. Tyrol is made aware that Tory murdered his wife, Cally, and kills her in revenge before the downloading is complete. Feeling betrayed, the Cylons resume fighting; after the other Cylons in CIC are killed, Cavil commits suicide. In the debris field, a chance rock strike causes Racetrack's hand to fall on the launch button for her Raptor's nuclear weapons; the missiles strike directly into the colony, knocking it out of orbit. With Galactica being dragged toward the singularity along with the colony, Adama orders Starbuck to jump the ship away, anywhere. Starbuck finds herself entering coordinates into the computer as if she were playing a song, using the notes which Hera had written. Galactica jumps away and out of danger, leaving the colony to inevitably fall to its destruction within the black hole.[6]

Galactica arrives at Kara's mysterious coordinates, its final destination as the damage caused in the battle has rendered the ship incapable of surviving any further jumps. Miraculously, the Galactica finds itself in orbit around a habitable world: our own Earth.

Hours later, the rest of the fleet has been summoned. Lee makes the unorthodox suggestion that they abandon their technology and start afresh, while Adama and others discover primitive humans already occupying the planet. Since finding Earth was always the goal of the Colonial Fleet, Adama suggests they call this planet Earth. The survivors - Galactica's crew, the remaining inhabitants of the fleet, and the Cylon Twos, Sixes and Eights - take basic supplies and spread out across the planet - not to colonize it but to blend in with primitive early humans, leaving Anders to fly the fleet into the Sun. The decision was made not to colonize this time, but to break the cycle. &quot;All this has happened before...&quot; but maybe it won't happen again. Leave it all behind and start over. &quot;We can give them the best part of ourselves, but not the baggage&quot;. The Rebel Cylons decide that their Centurions have earned their freedom, and give them control of the Basestar, which jumps away to parts unknown. Starbuck, her destiny completed, literally vanishes without a trace after saying goodbye to Lee.

Baltar and Caprica Six are visited by their Inner messengers, who inform them that their destinies - to save Hera - have been fulfilled, and the two decide to live out the rest of their lives together. Lee expresses his desire to venture off and explore the planet. Tyrol decides to settle by himself on a remote northern island (implied to be the Scottish highlands). Helo (Tahmoh Penikett), Athena and Hera are reunited as a family. Tigh and Ellen stay with the rest of the survivors. Adama leaves with Roslin, but while admiring the wildlife and looking for a place to build a cabin for them, Roslin dies peacefully. Adama finds the place where he will build the cabin, and buries Laura on a nearby hillside.&lt;br /&gt;[edit]&lt;br /&gt;Epilogue

New York City, 150,000 years later: humanity has reached the early 21st century, and the development of robotics and computerization continues unabated. Inner Baltar and Inner Six (no longer tied to the long-deceased Gaius Baltar and Caprica Six)[7] comment on the recent discovery of what is believed to be &quot;mitochondrial Eve&quot; in Tanzania... the remains of Hera Agathon, progenitor of modern day humanity. Inner Six disagrees with her counterpart about humanity's next future: when a complex system repeats, something new is bound to happen, and this Earth - descendant of devastated planets Kobol, Caprica and the original Earth - may escape the vicious circle of technology, all part of God's plan. &quot;You know it doesn't like that name,&quot; Inner Baltar replies, as the two stroll away</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5069">Plot

The series documents the events on New Caprica after the invasion by the Cylons at the end of the second season. It shows the activities of the resistance to Cylon occupation, and collaborators for the Cylons.

The resistance is headed by Colonel Saul Tigh, formerly XO of Galactica, and highest ranking military officer on New Caprica. He is joined by new parents Chief Tyrol and Specialist Cally, former Galactica crewman Jammer, and Caprica resistance fighter Jean Barolay.

The series begins on the 67th day of Cylon occupation. It is learned that among the Cylons' first acts of occupation was the building of a detention center. The Cylons have also started recruiting for a human New Caprica Police (NCP) force. Former Galactica pilot Duck, whom Jammer has been courting for the resistance, condemns the NCP as collaborators but is reluctant to get involved with Tigh's group because he is newly married. As the series progresses, Duck's wife Nora is killed in a Cylon attack on a temple where Tigh and his team were storing weapons.

Although the tragedy kills 10 people, Tigh sees the opportunity to win support over to the resistance. Jammer is torn about the event, since he believed storing weapons in a temple was a sin. He is taken to a private meeting with an Aaron Doral Cylon, where he is asked to support the Cylons' plan for peace, by reporting on any more resistance movement.

Afterwards, Jammer is given a chip (to report Resistance activity) and along with other resistance operatives, attends the baptismal of Nicholas Tyrol. Colonel Tigh has started plans to manufacture explosives near a hospital due to increased size of the resistance. It is discovered that in an act of revenge, Duck has joined the New Caprica Police as a spy for the resistance. Meanwhile, it is assumed that Jammer has become a Cylon collaborator - both men, ironically, becoming the very things they resisted earlier



Webisode 1 September 5, 2006&lt;br /&gt;It is the 67th day of the occupation of New Caprica. Tyrol and Tigh have organized a resistance movement, but recruiting new soldiers and storing weapons is becoming dangerous and difficult. Meanwhile, Jammer, Duck, and his wife Nora discuss the Cylon-run and human-staffed New Caprica Police.

&lt;br /&gt;Webisode 2 September 7, 2006&lt;br /&gt;Duck upsets Tyrol by rejecting an offer to join the resistance due to his focus on starting a family. Later, Jean Barolay and Tigh agree to hide weapons in the city's temple, a move that disturbs Jammer.

&lt;br /&gt;Webisode 3 September 12, 2006&lt;br /&gt;While the resistance secretly hides weapons inside the temple, Nora asks the gods for a child and is pleased when Duck tells her of his rejection of Tyrol's offer to join the resistance.

&lt;br /&gt;Webisode 4 September 14, 2006&lt;br /&gt;Cally and Nora are visiting the temple when Cylons arrive at the temple, presumably to look for the weapons hidden there by the resistance, and open fire after being met with resistance by civilians in the temple. Cally falls to the ground with her child, but Nora is shot and killed.

&lt;br /&gt;Webisode 5 September 19, 2006&lt;br /&gt;Duck, visibly distraught over his wife's death, is visited by Tyrol and Jammer. When Tyrol tells him that the Cylons attacked the temple because the resistance had hidden weapons there, Duck angrily tells them to leave.

&lt;br /&gt;Webisode 6 September 21, 2006&lt;br /&gt;Tigh and Barolay discuss how the attack at the temple has increased the support of the human population for the resistance and given them hundreds of new recruits, benefits that Jammer does not believe were worth the lives of the ten people killed at the temple.

&lt;br /&gt;Webisode 7 September 26, 2006&lt;br /&gt;When Jammer is captured by the Cylons, Tigh worries that he will sell out the resistance, a view that is not shared by Tyrol. In the New Caprica Detention Center, Jammer is visited by a Number Five, who wishes to discuss the events at the temple.

&lt;br /&gt;Webisode 8 September 28, 2006&lt;br /&gt;When Number Five offers Jammer the chance to become an informant on the resistance, saying that it will save lives and work towards peace between Cylons and humans, Jammer balks at the proposition. However, Number Five gives Jammer a keycard to access the detention center should he change his mind.

&lt;br /&gt;Webisode 9 October 3, 2006&lt;br /&gt;While Duck begins to clean up his tent and breaks down in mourning over his wife, Tyrol greets Jammer as he is released from detention. When asked about what the Cylons questioned him about, Jammer only responds that he did not tell the Cylons anything about the resistance.

&lt;br /&gt;Webisode 10 October 5, 2006&lt;br /&gt;Tyrol is informed by Duck that he has joined the New Caprica Police in order to gather information for the resistance. Meanwhile, Tigh and Jean Barolay discuss their plan to produce explosives in the grain silo, located across from the hospital. When Tigh seems unconcerned about the potential for civilian casualties, Jammer leaves the room and joins Duck outside. Once Duck has left, Jammer reaches into his pocket and looks at the keycard Number Five gave him.</text>

The series is set during the final stages of the First Cylon War. It focuses on a younger William &quot;Husker&quot; Adama in his fighter pilot days aboard Galactica while on an important mission to uncover the Cylons' “super weapon” on a mysterious icy planet.

The webisode series starts on the 4,571st day of the war (about 40 years before the destruction of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol). While Galactica is fighting Cylon threats, Adama faces his own problems when he discovers his lover has been gravely injured after her raptor is attacked by the Cylons. Adama soon finds himself swung into action shooting down Cylon raiders, but after a head-on collision with a raider, ejects and lands on the nearby planet, only to be confronted by the unexpected reality of what the Cylons have been working on.



Day 4,571 Wayne Rose Michael Taylor October 5, 2007&lt;br /&gt;A young William Adama, on Galactica, speculates with a close fellow fighter pilot about the ship’s current mission.

&lt;br /&gt;The Hangar Wayne Rose Michael Taylor October 12, 2007&lt;br /&gt;Adama recognises a familiar face amongst some wounded in the midst of “Operation Raptor Talon”.

&lt;br /&gt;Operation Raptor Talon Félix Enríquez Alcalá Michael Taylor October 19, 2007&lt;br /&gt;While Columbia and a Cylon Basestar battle above an icy planet, Adama’s squadron battle the Cylon Raiders. As the fight draws to a close with Columbia's destruction, Adama, as an impulsive response for revenge, blindly follows two of the Raiders into the planet’s atmosphere.

&lt;br /&gt;Free Fall Félix Enríquez Alcalá Michael Taylor October 26, 2007&lt;br /&gt;As Adama freefalls through the planet’s atmosphere, he finds himself in an awkward position as he encounters a Cylon Centurion.

&lt;br /&gt;The Lab Félix Enríquez Alcalá Michael Taylor November 2, 2007&lt;br /&gt;Adama begins to investigate the mysterious building on the planet’s surface only to inadvertently discover the remnants of Cylon’s violent experiments with humans.

&lt;br /&gt;Survivors Félix Enríquez Alcalá Michael Taylor November 9, 2007&lt;br /&gt;Several live humans are discovered in a vault-like room while the sudden vibrations of a Cylon ship can be heard. Adama is faced with a difficult decision of saving himself or rescuing the trapped captives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3414">Plot

Nine days after discovering Earth (following &quot;[[Revelations]]&quot;, i.e., episode 12 of the fourth season), Galactica and the fleet are back in space. Lt. Felix Gaeta is on board a Raptor with two Cylon number Eights (&quot;Sweet Eight&quot; and &quot;Pilot Eight&quot;) and three other humans (Raptor crew &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Shark&quot;, and deckhand mechanic Brooks) en route to the Zephyr when a DRADIS contact prompts the fleet to execute an emergency jump. A computer error results in the Raptor jumping to an unknown location beyond the Red Line. Stranded without a functioning FTL drive, those on board face the grim realization that they may run out of oxygen before they are rescued.

Tensions between human and Cylon passengers are aggravated when Pilot Eight attempts to aid Brooks with a mechanical repair, but is electrocuted. When the pliers she was using are found to have been stripped of insulation, those remaining begin to suspect foul play. Brooks is the next victim, this time the cause of death being a fatal dose of morpha.

Meanwhile, Lt. Hoshi acquires permission to participate in a SAR mission for the missing Raptor. Accompanied by pilot Racetrack, they discuss Hoshi and Gaeta’s romantic relationship, their perception of Gaeta’s moral character, and fading hope of finding survivors.

Flashbacks show that months ago during the Cylon occupation on New Caprica, Gaeta was involved romantically with Sweet Eight. He provided her with names of missing or detained resistance members under the impression that she would attempt to free them, when in actuality they were being executed.

Sweet Eight tells Gaeta if she connects with the Raptor, she can determine where the error was made. Gaeta helps her until he discovers Shark and Easy are dead, their throats slashed with the scalpel he provided to Sweet Eight in the process of connecting with the Raptor, earlier. She rationalizes her actions by explaining people kill when necessary (the limited supply of oxygen prompted her to murder the other Raptor passengers; she viewed resistance members on New Caprica as enemy combatants).

Sweet Eight accuses Gaeta of having been aware, on some level, of her true intentions on New Caprica, but that he chose self-delusion. She suggests that perhaps human and Cylon are not so different after all. Just as Gaeta stabbed Gaius Baltar with a pen in the episode &quot;[[Taking a Break from All Your Worries]]&quot; after he threatened to reveal Gaeta as a double agent (&quot;I know what your Eight did&quot;), Gaeta, livid, stabs Sweet Eight with the scalpel, leaving him the sole survivor aboard the Raptor.

Gaeta is wavering in an attempted overdose of morpha when Hoshi and Racetrack finally find him. Back aboard Galactica, Gaeta expresses intense displeasure with the Cylon alliance. He demands to speak to the Admiral, threatening Tigh in the process. A cryptic message to Lt. Hoshi, &quot;You found me and you saved me, so I'll protect you. And if this doesn't work out, if I'm wrong, then you have a bright future, Louis. But keep your head down,&quot; foreshadows Gaeta's actions in subsequent episodes

Zarek is a charismatic and philosophical populist political leader from the Colony of Sagittaron, who was jailed twenty years before the Cylon holocaust for terrorist activities (he planted explosives in a government building, destroying it and causing many deaths) and for spurring political unrest. After the destruction of the Twelve Colonies, he and a number of other inmates find themselves stuck on the Astral Queen, a prison ship which joins the Battlestar Galactica in fleeing the Cylons.

Gathering followers among the prisoners, Zarek leads a riot against the leadership of the ragtag fleet, protesting the poor living conditions on the Astral Queen. He creates a hostage situation which then-Commander Adama and President Roslin must resolve in the midst of a crisis of water supply in the fleet. (&quot;[[Bastille Day]]&quot;).

Biography

Zarek is a charismatic and philosophical populist political leader from the Colony of [[Sagittaron]], who was jailed twenty years before the Cylon holocaust for terrorist activities (he planted explosives in a government building, destroying it and causing many deaths) and for spurring political unrest. After the destruction of the Twelve Colonies, he and a number of other inmates find themselves stuck on the Astral Queen, a prison ship which joins the Battlestar Galactica in fleeing the Cylons.

Gathering followers among the prisoners, Zarek leads a riot against the leadership of the ragtag fleet, protesting the poor living conditions on the Astral Queen. He creates a hostage situation which then-Commander Adama and President Roslin must resolve in the midst of a crisis of water supply in the fleet. (&quot;Bastille Day&quot;). As an homage to the original 1970s series, at one point in the episode Zarek and Lee Adama are in discussion sitting opposite each other in one of the cells. One of Zarek's co-conspirators calls &quot;Apollo!&quot;, at which point they both turn in recognition.

Later in the series, Zarek runs for political office, and is elected representative for [[Sagittaron]] on the new [[Quorum of Twelve]] (the upper house of the legislative branch of the government, and the only one expedient to use under the circumstances). He then runs for the vacant office of Vice President, in a power play meant to take a step towards ascending to the presidency, but is defeated when Roslin makes a surprise replacement for her own nominee, and Dr. Gaius Baltar is elected Vice President.

Actor Richard Hatch has stated that Zarek ran for office because &quot;he's always looking for positions where he can leverage himself, where he can have more influence. He obviously believes that he's fighting for the people, but very much so often the idealistic revolutionary becomes the self-serving politician. So often, what you think is for the people ends up being for you. I think that happens to so many political leaders. They start out for beneficial reasons but they get caught up in the process for their own purposes and agendas.&quot;

During the time in which Col. Tigh imposed martial law on the fleet, Zarek assists Lee Adama in hiding Roslin from the military. (&quot;Resistance&quot;). While on the run, he unsuccessfully tries to persuade the younger Adama to record a message to the fleet publicly denouncing his father for ordering Roslin's arrest. (&quot;The Farm&quot;). After the Astral Queen leads the pro-Roslin faction to Kobol, Zarek and his lieutenant, Meier, accompany Roslin's party to the planet's surface, ostensibly to provide security as they search for the Tomb of Athena. Zarek tries to dissuade Meier from his plan of assassinating Lee to no avail, and Meier ends up dead when the plan fails. (&quot;Home&quot;).

Soon after reuniting with the fleet, Lee turns to Zarek for information on his &quot;shady friends,&quot; who control a black market for essential goods. Zarek names a gangster named [[Phelan]], who is later killed by Lee. Although he denies any involvement in the black market saying that he broke off contact with Phelan when he discovered Phelan's child prostitution ring, Zarek is nevertheless shown associating with one of the late Phelan's former henchmen. (&quot;[[Black Market]]&quot;).

Subsequently, Zarek goes on to become Gaius Baltar's campaign manager in his bid against Laura Roslin. He engineers a winning platform that called for the fleet to settle on an isolated, newly discovered planet later dubbed &quot;[[New Caprica]].&quot; When Baltar is elected President of the Twelve Colonies, Zarek became his vice president. Zarek was placed in confinement, however, when he refused to collaborate with the Cylons after they forced the surrender of the Baltar administration. He, along with Laura Roslin and [[Cally Tyro]]l, was one of 200 citizens sentenced to death by the Cylon-controlled Colonial Government. Believing themselves to be doomed, Zarek elicited a confession from Roslin about the election fraud that almost denied Baltar the presidency. Upon hearing the truth from Roslin, Zarek admitted that in light of the Cylon occupation, settling on New Caprica was a bad idea. The group is saved at the last minute by the human resistance movement.

After Galactica's return to help the remnants of humanity escape, Baltar is left with the Cylons. Zarek becomes president of the Colonies, but decides to step down, believing that without the military's support he wouldn't be able to control the fleet. Before his resignation, he appoints Laura Roslin as his Vice President. Although saying he would like any position in Roslin's new administration, Zarek is clearly surprised when Roslin asks him to be her new Vice President. Before Roslin resumed her presidency, Zarek in conjunction with Saul Tigh secretly authorized &quot;[[The Circle]]&quot; to carry out death squad executions of those who collaborated with the Cylons on New Caprica. Roslin is horrified when she learns of this, but Zarek says that the fleet needs quick justice to prevent chaos and that Roslin's new mandate needs to start with clean hands. The executions are stopped when Roslin declared a general amnesty in her inaugural address. After Baltar is returned by the Cylons to the Colonials during the Eye of Jupiter incident, Zarek repeatedly counsels Roslin against giving him a public trial, again citing the potential for chaos in the fleet that could ensue. He strongly advises Roslin to declare martial law as a precaution during the trial. When Zarek leaves, Roslin and Tory note that Zarek seemed extremely worried about possible unrest, as Zarek's political philosophy has always been fundamentally opposed to martial law.

When Roslin is kidnapped by renegade Cylons in the episode &quot;[[Sine Qua Non]]&quot;, Zarek, under the [[Colonial Constitution]], declared himself &quot;Acting President&quot; pending Roslin's return. Although the Quorum of 12 fully supported Zarek's actions, Lee Adama later advises him to step down due to the fact that the military will not back Zarek's administration. Zarek reluctantly agrees to exercise a provision that allows for an &quot;Interim President&quot; to be appointed in a time of crisis. This results in Lee Adama becoming interim president until Roslin is returned to the fleet.

After the fleet finds Earth to be a desolate, irradiated wasteland, Roslin retreats from the public eye, leaving Zarek as the government's de facto leader. In &quot;[[A Disquiet Follows My Soul]],&quot; tensions quickly arise between him and Admiral Adama over the latter's plan to install advanced Cylon jump drives on all civilian ships. While the admiral believes the use of Cylon technology will expedite the discovery of a new homeworld, Zarek sees it as an illegal military usurpation of civilian authority, and yet another step towards an unwise permanent alliance with the rebel Cylons. At Zarek's behest, the Quorum soon passes legislation forbidding Cylon engineers from boarding any ship whose captain refuses them, and Zarek privately exhorts the fleet to resist Adama's attempts to force compliance. The fleet's tylium ship, the &quot;[[Hitei Kan]],&quot; jumps away shortly after communicating with Zarek; Admiral Adama then has the Vice President arrested. In Galactica's brig, Adama confronts him with a stack of documents purportedly proving that Zarek is corrupt. Although it transpires that the documents are merely ship laundry slips, Zarek relents, giving Adama the coordinates to which the &quot;Hitei Kan&quot; jumped.

Not long afterward, [[Felix Gaeta]] visits Zarek in the brig, proposing a mutiny and coup d'état. Zarek agrees. In &quot;[[The Oath]]&quot;, Gaeta sets his plan in motion, removing Zarek from the brig and escorting him to the hangar deck. Claiming to have spotted a dangerous fuel leak, co-conspirator Racetrack clears the deck of all personnel save for Crew Chief Laird and Jeanne, one of Baltar's acolytes. A suspicious Laird is about to contact the LSO when Zarek strikes him in the back of the head with a wrench, killing him. Racetrack then flies Zarek back to Colonial One, where he claims to Lee Adama that the Admiral had changed his mind about the imprisonment. Zarek remains in communication with Gaeta throughout the mutiny aboard Galactica, expressing annoyance when he hears that Admiral Adama had not been killed but congratulating Gaeta on his good work.

Shortly after [[Gaeta]] seizes control of Galactica, Zarek meets with the Quorum. When it becomes clear that the Quorum will not follow Zarek as the new President, Zarek orders the entire Quorum to be executed.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4101">Battlestar Galactica (1978)

In the 1978 version of Battlestar Galactica, the Quorum of Twelve—referred to there as the &quot;Council of Twelve&quot;—was the civilian government mentioned occasionally on the show. Most day-to-day aspects of civilian life were handled by the quorum; however, they typically left military decisions to Adama and his crew. The Council has its own security force, but interestingly uses Colonial Warriors for security in their own meeting chamber. There is little love lost between Security and the Warriors.

Commander Adama, in addition to his role as commander of the Battlestar fleet, was a member of the original Quorum. Adama is presumably the representative from Caprica, though how he held that office while commanding a Battlestar is a matter not addressed in the series. Adama was one of two members that survived the destruction of the colonies. After the destruction, Adama presides over a new version of the Quorum.

In &quot;[[Saga of a Star World]]&quot;, Count Baltar appears as another member of the original Quorum, betraying the colonies on the condition that his colony was to be subjugated instead of destroyed by the Cylons. In &quot;[[Lost Planet of the Gods]]&quot;, Baltar points out that his seal is the same as Adama's and so he was able to enter the pyramid.

A pivotal character who later disappears is Sire Uri, who is appointed to the new Council during &quot;Saga of a Star World&quot;.

All of the Council members seen in &quot;[[Saga of a Star World]]&quot; have been replaced by the time of &quot;[[Baltar's Escape]]&quot; wherein the entire Council is captured in the Galactica landing bay while greeting representatives of the Eastern Alliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battlestar Galactica (2004)

In the episode &quot;[[Colonial Day]]&quot;, the civilian government was reconstituted, as elections were held for new representatives from the twelve colonies: [[Caprica]], [[Gemenon]], [[Tauron]], [[Aquaria]], [[Canceron]], [[Sagittaron]], [[Virgon]], [[Picon]], [[Libris]], [[Aerelon]], [[Leonis]], and [[Scorpia]]. Each Colony (the surviving humans from those colonies) elects one delegate who votes on their behalf. The President of the Twelve Colonies acts as the chairperson. As seen in the episode &quot;Colonial Day&quot; the first issues they were forced to deal with included education, distributing of medical and food supplies, and the election of a Vice President. The first meeting coincided with the 52nd Colonial Day which celebrates the signing of the Articles of Colonization; the founding of a unified government for the twelve colonies.

When President Laura Roslin was arrested and the fleet placed under martial law following a coup d'état by Commander William Adama in orbit above Kobol (&quot;Kobol's Last Gleaming&quot;), Colonel Saul Tigh tried to justify Roslin's arrest and the suspension of civilian government to the Quorum of Twelve by showing them what he thought would be Roslin in an incapacitated and delusional state (&quot;[[Fragged]]&quot;). However after an impassioned speech to the Quorum (after which it was clear their loyalties lay with her, and not the military) Roslin led a civilian revolt which eventually returned civilian rule to the fleet.

It appears that the President can make appointments to the Quorum when vacancies appear in its membership; Lee Adama was appointed the Caprican delegate, apparently after the death or resignation of his predecessor (&quot;[[The Ties That Bind]]&quot;). It also appears that the Quorum can select the Acting President in case of the incapacitation of the President; it selected Lee Adama to be Acting President after Roslin's disappearance aboard a Cylon rebel basestar (&quot;[[Sine Qua Non]]&quot;).

All members of The Quorum, except for Lee (who only survived a murder attempt thanks to Starbuck), are murdered by Galactica Marines at Vice President Tom Zarek's command during the mutiny for not supporting his coup (&quot;[[Blood on the Scales]]&quot;). Afterward, Roslin and Lee decided not to reconstitute the Quorum of Twelve, since the Twelve Colonies no longer existed. Instead, a new council was derived with representatives from each vessel in the fleet (&quot;[[No Exit]]&quot;).</text>

The Brenik was a small military vessel, with a crew complement of 75. It was a former posting of Colonel Tigh, who served aboard her as an enlisted gunner's mate (and still a teenager) during the second year of the Cylon War. The Brenik was attacked and boarded by Cylon Centurions, leaving only 20 survivors (Tigh included). The bloody hand-to-hand shipboard combat that ensued left Tigh with mental scars that would last for the rest of his lif</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4052">In her first appearance in the series, Kat is a rookie Viper pilot aboard the Battlestar Galactica, part of a group being trained by then Lieutenant [[Kara Thrace]] (Starbuck).[1] Although a rookie, she is very sharp and talented, and quickly becomes a hot-shot pilot, taking part in a vital operation to attack a Cylon tylium refinery base.[2]

As the fatigue and stress of weeks of continuous duty without relief mount, Kat turns to stimulants to keep her senses sharp. Ultimately, she overdoses on stims, becomes hysterical, and finds herself unable to safely land her Viper. She is talked down into a near crash-landing by her former instructor, Starbuck, and is temporarily hospitalized.[3]

After Captain Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama and Starbuck are transferred to the Battlestar Pegasus by Admiral Helena Cain, Kat becomes Galactica's senior pilot, leading the Galactica Air Wing in what amounts to a game of &quot;chicken&quot; with the [[Pegasus Air Wing]].[4]

The rivalry between Kat and Starbuck, arguably the two best pilots on Galactica, intensifies with the passage of time. Kat comes to disdain her former flight instructor on account of her drunken and irresponsible behavior; Starbuck considers Kat to be an upstart with a too-high opinion of her own abilities. Circumstances lead to Starbuck and Kat flying as a pair on a Combat air patrol during which they encounter the ace Cylon Raider nicknamed &quot;Scar.&quot; Starbuck is the first to spot &quot;[[Scar]],&quot; and comes close to trying to kill &quot;him&quot; in suicidal head-on pass; at the last moment, she breaks away and lures &quot;Scar&quot; into Kat's line of fire. As Kat is the one who fires the killing shots, she earns the title of Galactica's &quot;Top Gun&quot;, thereby also winning a personal bet against Starbuck.[5]

During the settlement of New Caprica, with Commander Lee Adama in command of Pegasus and Starbuck down on the ground, Kat becomes the [[CAG]] of Galactica, leading the decoy attacks that lured the Cylons away from New Caprica, clearing the way for Galactica to jump in and deploy the real strike force.[6] Following the successful recovery of the civilian population from New Caprica and the destruction of the Pegasus, Lee Adama resumes his old post of CAG: however, Kat remains a senior member of [[Galactica's Air Wing]] as a squadron leader.[7]

As the Galactica and its Raptors guide the civilian fleet in relays through a treacherous stellar cluster, it is revealed the real Louanne Katraine was a woman who died two days prior to the Cylon attack on Caprica. A drug runner by the name of Sasha, seeking to change her life, took the deceased's identity and became the individual known thereafter as Louanne &quot;Kat&quot; Katraine. After Starbuck discovers this, Kat begs her not to inform Admiral William Adama but instead to allow Kat to do so herself. On the fourth and penultimate relay through the cluster, Kat receives a dose of radiation sufficient to have her removed from flight status, and begins losing hair. She chooses to accept her past and present life: she has a sexual encounter with her former associate Enzo, swaps her radiation badge for that of Captain Karl &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon, and boards her Raptor for the last time. She stays in the cluster after Admiral Adama issues the jump order in order to see her assigned ship, the Faru Sadin, safely to the other side. In doing so, she receives a fatal dose of radiation. Admiral Adama visits her deathbed. He later promotes her posthumously to CAG on account of her bravery. Kat tries to tell Adama the truth about her past, but Adama, perhaps suspecting what she's going to reveal (in a deleted scene for Exodus Part 2 he indicated he already had some idea), tells her not to tell him, not caring about her past but about what she had done stating that what brought her to that point didn't matter.[8] Although it was not made explicit in the scene, Battlestar Galactica showrunner Ronald D. Moore made it clear in his podcast for &quot;The Passage&quot; it was intended that Adama should look on Katraine, like Kara Thrace, as an &quot;adopted daughter&quot; of sorts</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2915">[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]]Cloud 9

Cloud 9 was a massive vessel of unusual design that contained a five-star restaurant, theater, casino, several bars, and numerous hotel rooms and luxury suites. Its most notable feature was a huge biodome which contained a pressurized natural habitat nearly a quarter-mile in diameter that simulated an outdoor park. The dome was mounted to the starboard side of the ship's main hull by a &quot;V&quot; shaped pylon structure which supported a spoon-shaped bow that contained the hotel. Behind the hotel section was a separately attached crew module which also contained the ship's hangar bay, command bridge, engineering, and sub-light/FTL drive engines. Directly under the saucer dome were another set of drive engines.

Inside the dome, many varieties of trees and plants from the Twelve Colonies were grown on the grounds and were cared for by a dedicated gardening staff. The dome also contained an artificial lake used for swimming. At the center of the park was a large auditorium structure used for gatherings and festivals. This building was used by Laura Roslin as the meeting place for the new Quorum of Twelve after the Cylon attack on the Colonies. The dome used any natural sunlight that was available, in an attempt to replicate the atmospheric conditions of a planet's sky. However, Cloud 9 was still a spaceship, and didn't really live up to the quality of a real planet, as there were some flaws in the design—such as fake terrain used to disguise the machinery as well as the easily noticeable and massive support beams of the sky dome. Despite this, Cloud 9 was judged to be one of the nicer places to live in the colonial fleet.

The ship was primarily used as a hotel and resort which had hosted various diplomatic functions and been the site of a terrorist assassination plot against President Laura Roslin, most notably during an electoral meeting for the [[Quorum of Twelve]] council, in which the radical [[Tom Zarek]] attempted to manipulate the council into voting him into the position of Vice President.

The ship had an &quot;open port&quot; policy and did not keep track of those who came and went, which caused numerous security problems and allowed members of the terrorist group &quot;[[Demand Peace]]&quot; to use it as a base of operations. Even President Roslin herself fled to Cloud 9 during Commander Adama's military coup.

Cloud 9 was destroyed in the [[Season 2 ]]finale episode &quot;[[Lay Down Your Burdens, Part II]]&quot;, along with at least three other ships including a Colonial Movers freighter. A nuclear warhead, which was given to the Cylon agent Gina by then-Vice-President Gaius Baltar, was used to destroy the ship. The shock wave from the nuclear explosion left behind an identifiable signature that was discovered by a Cylon patrol one light-year away. One year after the destruction of the ship, the signature led a Cylon invasion force to New Caprica.</text>

Colonial Movers is a transport company that owned at least three cargo ships in the refugee fleet. They appear as long, cylindrical shafts to which are affixed several bulk cargo modules of various livery design and nomenclature. The slogan &quot;We Move Anywhere&quot; can sometimes be seen on the side.

In the episode &quot;[[The Hand of God]]&quot;, a Colonial Movers ship partook in the sneak attack of the Cylon tylium refinery. A squadron of Vipers was hidden inside a cargo module as reserve and launched against the Cylon tylium refinery which Apollo destroyed.

In the episode &quot;[[Lay Down Your Burdens, Part II]]&quot;, one of the Colonial Movers vessels is destroyed during the explosion of [[Cloud 9]].

The same ship design appears in the original series.</text>

A freighter within the fleet that appears in Battlestar Galactica: The Plan as the ship a Cylon [[Number Four]], ([[Simon]]), lives on with his wife Giana and stepdaughter Jemmy. Brother Cavil, who is trying to fulfill his plan of annihilating the human race, becomes angry when he finds out Simon has married a human. As Cavil passes orders to the Cylons in the fleet, he tells Simon to blow up the Cybele, but Simon requests his wife and child be spared. Cavil refuses, in fact stating the death of the woman and child will prevent them from ever knowing that Simon is really a Cylon. Simon returns to the Cybele, but commits suicide by jettisoning himself out an airlock. His version was not uploaded to the Resurrection Ship because it was too far away.

The vessel was mentioned several times in the series but was not seen until The Plan (although a ship resembling it and Scylla did appear in several fleet shots in Season 4</text>

The Gemenon Traveler was mentioned in the finale of Season 2. Its fate since then is unknown as it hasn't been seen since the New Caprica colonization.

During the miniseries, Gemini is originally part of Roslin's refugee fleet before joining the Battlestar Galactica.

A second Gemini freighter would be seen with it several times throughout the series after the Season 1 episode, [[Hand of God]].

The ship is a carry-over design of the Gemini, (an ordnance freighter), from the original series.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1512">[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]]The Book of Judges (Hebrew: Sefer Shoftim ספר שופטים) is the seventh book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. Its title describes its contents: it contains the history of Biblical judges, divinely inspired leaders whose direct knowledge of Yahweh allows them to act as champions for the Israelites from oppression by foreign rulers, and models of wise and faithful behaviour required of them by their god Yahweh following the exodus from Egypt and conquest of Canaan.[1] The events of Judges are set &quot;between c. 1380 [B.C.E.] and the rise of Saul, c. 1050.&quot;[2] The stories follow a consistent pattern: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a leader or champion (a &quot;judge&quot;); the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression and they prosper, but soon they fall again into unfaithfulness and the cycle is repeated.[3]

Judges forms part of Deuteronomistic history, a theologically-oriented history of Israel from the entry into Canaan to the destruction of the Temple. The details of this history's composition are still widely debated, but most scholars place its origins, or at least its final form, in the 6th century BCE and the community of the Babylonian exile.[4] Nevertheless, fragments of Judges (such as the Song of Deborah) have been dated from much earlier, perhaps close to the period the book depicts.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="462">The Gideon was featured in the episodes &quot;[[Resistance]]&quot; and &quot;[[Final Cut]]&quot;. It was the cargo vessel which became the focus of attention once martial law was imposed upon the fleet. When the Gideon crew refused to resupply Galactica, Col. Tigh ordered the cargo to be taken by force which resulted in bloodshed. The media termed the event &quot;The Gideon Massacre&quot;. The ship's name comes from a character in the Holy Bible; Gideon was a judge in the Book of Judges.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1169">It is now one month since the bombing, and Zoe is having problems distinguishing her real self from her virtual self. Lacy is approached by Sister Clarice Willow, the head of Zoe and Lacy's school, the Athena Academy, and also a member of the STO cult, who takes a special interest in her. Joseph struggles to connect to his son William, who begins spending time more with his uncle Samuel.

Still haunted by Tamara's avatar, he attempts to contact Daniel again. Daniel, resigning himself to the loss of Zoe, turns his attention back to the mass-production order, and has the prototype moved to his home lab. While it is clear to him that the original Zoe-Cylon prototype exceeds the intelligence specs needed, it also exhibits erratic behavior. Meanwhile Amanda finally discovers from Agent Durham that her daughter had a secret boyfriend. At the terror memorial service, she learns more of the secret one-year relationship, and is given some of her daughter's effects (by Ben's mother) and finds an infinity symbol, which links Zoe to the STO.

She finally concedes that Zoe must have been involved with the STO, and makes an emotional public statement to that effect</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1202">After Amanda's revelation, the Graystones face the wrath of angered Capricans, culminating in Amanda's resignation from the hospital, and a violent altercation between Daniel and Samuel.

Lacy begins to be pressured by other students at school re. STO, and the Academy director, Clarice Willow, tries to learn more of the virtual Zoe as well. Daniel's assistant, Cyrus Xander, suggests hiring a well-known PR agent, to counteract the bad press effect on company share prices. Joseph's surviving son William wags school and as he feels more and more abandoned by his father.

He drifts further into the Ha'la'tha mafia milieu, encouraged by his uncle Sam. Meanwhile Agent Durham destroys a year-old video of a police interview with Ben, who was caught after curfew with bomb components in his schoolbag. He also leaks to the media how the Graystone residence is yet to be searched.

Later, Zoe discovers Tamara's avatar in a virtual holding area and releases her into the wider &quot;V-world&quot;, which consists of both licensed and hacked sites. Joseph again attempts to contact Tamara's avatar, but Daniel insists she is 'gone'. Frustrated, Joseph tells his brother to 'even the score' with the Graystones –</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1215">As public outrage keeps mounting, Daniel is finally persuaded to appear on the late-night television show Backtalk with Baxter Sarno and tell his side of the story. Agent Duram finally obtains permission to search both Zoe's former school and the Graystone residence, hoping to uncover evidence regarding the recent and possible future STO motivated attacks.

Clarice passes an e-sheet warning to STO members just in time for student Keon Gatwick to remove bomb materials from his locker. Frustrated by their lack of success, the detectives then turn their attention to examining electronic messages. Meanwhile Daniel succeeds in reclaiming a measure of sympathy on TV, particularly when Amanda suddenly appears onstage, and they agree that the 'moral vacuum' of holotechnology probably allowed STO to recruit vulnerable people like Zoe.

Daniel then promises his company will not profit from the lucrative but much maligned Holoband licensing anymore, and that they will also setup a charitable fund. Joseph, in spite of his mother-in-law Ruth's wishes, relents and manages to call off the blood-feud hit on Amanda. Later Lacy Rand tries to get help from Keon's STO cell to smuggle Zoe in her Cylon form to Gemenon</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1295">Joseph is having ongoing troubles with Willie, who continues to be absent from school, and is angry to find him working at the Tauron club with Sam. Tamara now wanders around the V-world nightclub and discovers, after being shot by Vesta, that she cannot be killed.

Compelled to work in return for her 'freedom', Tamara is led by Heracles, a young gamer, to New Cap City, a virtual version of Caprica City, where violence and crime abound. Meanwhile, on a fishing trip, a clearly bored Willie loses control and assaults a boy with a rock who taunted him.

Daniel Graystone is faced with the realization that the very steps he took to salvage his public image may in turn cost him control of Graystone Industries. He declares Holoband technology no longer relevant and uses the Zoe-Cylon prototype, codenamed U-87, to convince the board that artificial sentience is the way of the future – in creating a servile, tireless, and unquestioning race of workers.

After infiltrating a bank vault, and learning from Vesta that she is dead in real life, Tamara persuades Heracles to log out and alert her father that she is still alive. He arrives at the Adama residence just as the surviving family and friends gather for a Tauron memorial service, and is chased down the street by a confused Joseph</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1255">After the revelation that the avatar of his daughter Tamara is still lost in the holoband world, Joseph starts a quest to find her by tracking down the whereabouts and identity of Heracles.

Tomas, haunted by the death of his employees during the MCP chip heist, arrives on Caprica wanting to meet with Daniel. He then accuses that Daniel stole the MCP chip that is now the key to the U-87 Cylon and Graystone's military contract. Daniel confronts Joseph concerning the threat and demands to know how Tomas knew of his role in the theft, but Joseph worries primarily of retribution from the Guatrau towards his family.

Clarice, concerned that the off-world STO leadership has been backing a rogue named Barnabas Greeley, a man involved in the targeted bombings of holoband cafes, steps up her plans to acquire Zoe's avatar program. She befriends Amanda and successfully accesses the Graystone house and Daniel's PC. Meanwhile, wanting to fulfill her own promise to Zoe, Lacy goes with Keon to meet the elusive Barnabas, but is abruptly rebuffed.

Tomas makes an offer for Graystone's sports team, the C-Bucs, 300 million credits that could help Graystone Industries. His motive is not financial profit, but for his desire, as a Tauron, for blood revenge.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1263">Still seeking Zoe's Avatar program, Clarice redoubles her efforts to gain Amanda's confidence. Lacy's attempts to enlist the help of Barnabas have fallen short, producing tension between her and Zoe. Zoe continues her 'romance' with Philomon, a young scientist in her father's employ, in hopes that he can assist her in getting her out of the lab.

Tomas meets with Daniel and informs him of the rumor that Daniel's company only has one working MCP chip. At a C-Bucs game, he further attempts to pressure Daniel by telling him that he knows the MCP never worked for him. Behind a restaurant, Joseph corners Tad Thorean, a.k.a Heracles, and compels him to help find his daughter.

They both enter the game, but Heracles is soon &quot;killed&quot; helping Joseph, meaning he can never return to V-world and that Joseph is now on his own. Amanda, meanwhile, has been haunted by visions of her brother Darius, who died in a car crash several years ago, and reveals to Clarice (at the Dive Bar) that she &quot;totally lost it&quot; when he died. Joseph, now totally lost and clueless, is confronted by and hires the mysterious Emmanuelle as a guide. Daniel, based on Zoe's generative-analog theory (passed on via Philomon), finally suspects that Zoe's avatar is inhabiting the Cylon's MCP</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1241">Joseph and Emmanuelle seek Tamara at the New Cap equivalent of the Adama home, but the apartment is inhabited by a drug addict – an &quot;amphead&quot;. As the druggie yields the information that Joseph's daughter is at a club called &quot;Mysteries,&quot; a gang of drug dealers burst in on the scene and threaten to end his New Cap gamelife.

Emmanuelle then takes out the whole team with her pistol, and berates him for freezing up. Daniel tries to communicate with Zoe but without success, and later constructs a pyre around her. Although Zoe is agonized by memories of being trapped in a burning house when she was 5, she does not reveal herself. Amanda, still troubled by visions of her long-dead brother, returns to the scene of the fatal crash in an unsuccessful attempt to learn more. Joseph, now a regular Amp user himself, goes to the Mysteries club and finds evidence of Tamara - a stylized &quot;T&quot; signature of hers.

Tomas visits the Graystone house and tells Amanda about the theft and his two dead employees, but Amanda refuses to doubt her husband (who tests U-87 again by ordering her to shoot their pet dog). Later in V-world, Zoe pleads with Lacy to find a way to get her off of Caprica before she harms Daniel due to the nature of his 'tests'</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1362">In a 20 hour flash forward, U-87 is driving a stolen van with police choppers in pursuit. Earlier, it is revealed that Daniel's financial troubles are worsening, and he must sell the Buccaneers. Worse still, the army also knows the chip was stolen, and have given him only a week to finish the project.

The powerplay between Clarice and Barnabas also heats up, as both jostle for local STO dominance. Daniel orders the chip irradiated and Philo reluctantly undertakes his orders, but just as he does Zoe reveals herself to him and when he panics is forced to kill him, she then steals a van and speeds away.

On V-world, a fixated Joseph finally finds his daughter's avatar with the help of Emmanuelle (revealed as his assistant Evelyn). But Tamara shoots herself, and then her father, so that he can't come back to New Cap City, and is finally forced to come to terms with her death. Lacy tries to push the shipment forward, and discovers that Barnabas is about to detonate a bomb (that she help plant) in Clarice's car. Clarice, on her way to the terminal, is caught in traffic at the Pantheon Bridge. She then spots Amanda, clearly shocked by Daniel's complicity in the murders, preparing to jump. She leaves the car, just as the bomb detonates, and Amanda steps off. U-87 approaches a heavily armed roadblock, and Zoe slams through it, destroying the Cylon.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3048">Following the destruction of Admiral [[Nagala]]'s flagship, the Battlestar [[Atlantia]], Commander William Adama of the Battlestar Galactica ordered the remnants of the fleet to regroup at [[Ragnar Anchorage]] for a counterattack; however, with nearly the entire Colonial military fleet destroyed, it was a civilian convoy led by newly-sworn-in Colonial President Laura Roslin that responded to the orders.

Facing limited options, Commander Adama chose to have the Galactica defend the convoy while each ship jumped into deep space, away from the destroyed colonies. The Galactica managed to hold off two Cylon basestars as ship after ship executed faster-than-light jumps to a safe location. When the civilian ships had jumped, the Galactica then joined them. Nevertheless, less than 50,000 Humans - out of 50 billion - had survived the holocaust. Galactica and its fleet of refugees would later find that they were not the sole survivors.

At least one other battlestar, the aforementioned Pegasus, had also escaped destruction. Lt. [[Karl &quot;Helo&quot; Agathon]] and [[Lt. Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace]] would also learn that some humans had managed to survive the Cylon attack on Caprica. While this implies that at least some humans left behind by Galactica may have survived the Cylon attack and occupation of the [[Twelve Colonies]], it is unknown if any did.

After the fight at Ragnar, the fleet jumped past the [[Red Line]] and into uncharted space to find a new home. Unknown to the new Fleet, they ended up with thirteen Cylons within it: the [[Final Five]], the Cavil responsible for the destruction of the Colonies and the war that followed, two [[Sixes]], a [[Doral]], a [[Leoben]], a [[Three]], a [[Simon]] and a [[Sharon]] who was a sleeper agent on Galactica. A year later, the human fleet would link up with another survivor of the attack, the Battlestar Pegasus. Eventually the survivors discovered a habitable planet they named New Caprica and were able to settle on it for a year before being invaded by the Cylons and captured. The fleet was able to escape but not without thousands of casualties and the loss of Battlestar Pegasus under command of Commander Lee Adama.

According to Saul Tigh in Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance, twenty billion people died in the attack of the Twelve Colonies; in &quot;[[A Disquiet Follows My Soul]]&quot;, both Kara Thrace and Felix Gaeta put the number at fifty billion.

After five years of searching, the Colonials found a new world and named it Earth. Just before Earth was found, Galactica faced the Cylons in a final climactic battle and destroyed them forever. All that were left was a group of rebel Cylons that had allied with the human fleet and settled with them, while its surviving, remnant mechanical counterparts, having finally been freed by the humans and rebel Cylons to &quot;find their own destiny&quot;, would eventually leave the galaxy in peace, never to return.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1739">Unbeknownst to Dr. Baltar, his lover and co-writer of the CNP turns out to be a version of the humanoid Cylon known as Number Six.

Installed in the central computers of Vipers and Raptors and in the navigation computers of almost all battlestars, the CNP was more than two years in the making

The Cylon infiltrator programmed backdoors into the CNP so that the Cylon attack forces could render any ships that use the operating system to shut itself down by a remote command.

Battlestars and fighters begin to shut down during the Colonial defensive &quot;as if a switch were flipped.&quot;[3] Communications officer Dualla describes reports of &quot;system failures&quot; throughout the Fleet and how at least one battlestar loses power when the attack begins, which indicates, that the Cylons use the CNP to damage and, in at least one case, disable capital ships as well.

The CNP was previously received by Galactica, but the program was never loaded into the primary memory of the ship's navigation computer.

Galactica herself is spared from Cylon computer attacks as the CNP is not loaded on any of her computers, nor were her computer systems networked, sparing the ship from any backdoor or cracking attempts.

Unfortunately, Galactica does support a modern squadron of Viper Mark VII fighters, which received the upgrade. As a result, the squadron is massacred by two Raiders on their way back to Caprica.

Lieutenant Felix Gaeta has the CNP source code purged from the mainframe on Baltar's instruction. The program is also retrograded on the flight systems of surviving Mark VII Vipers, Raptors, and civilian ships

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">The battlestar Pegasus, commanded by Admiral Helena Cain, is docked at the shipyards in order to undergo a three-month systems overhaul when the attack occurs. In preparation for the refit, all computer networks are shut down, leaving the battlestar largely unaffected by Cylon-infiltrated [[Command Navigation Program,CNP]]. During the attack, Colonel Belzen reports that all computers are down and that the crew must perform all functions manually.

Tethered to its dock, Pegasus is swarmed by Raiders and struck by several missiles. Fuel and ordnance ignite on the battlestar's hangar decks, causing explosions that cause over 700 casualties. Cain orders a hasty departure from the dock, and the ship fires its reverse thrusters and tears itself free from the burning shipyard's umbilicals.

With Pegasus's defenses still down, and two nuclear missile inbound, Cain orders the CIC crew to spin up the FTL drive and to perform a blind jump on her command, despite the risk of reemerging inside a celestial body. The nuclear detonations throughout the shipyard create bursts of electromagnetic radiation that mask the jump and fool the Cylons into believing that the ship is destroyed (TRS: &quot;[[Pegasus]]&quot;; &quot;[[Razor]]&quot;).

Defensively, the structure features vary little and must rely on The Fleet for long term defense, however, the structure includes various Viper hangars, and anti-aircraft turrets along the entire length of the structure.

In the opening moments of the attacks, the Cylons are able to surprise the Colonials by detonating multiple nuclear warheads in range of the shipyards, eliminating the use of DRADIS and blinding both sides involved. The detonations cause moderate damage to the facilities themselves, but leave them intact, indicating they were not directly hit. On fire, and all but defenseless, multiple squadrons of Raiders are then able to jump in and have at the facilities with relative ease, despite being blind. The subsequent assault ultimately destroys the facilities, and various Colonial craft caught in the middle. However, one battlestar was able to escape destruction, break free of her berths, and escape the battle (TRS: &quot;Razor&quot;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">When Pegasus jumps into the area, twelve enemy contacts are picked up on DRADIS, and Admiral Cain orders the launch of Blue Squadron. As the Vipers are deployed, 15 Raider squadrons jump into firing range and the crew realizes, to their horror, that the installation is not a communications relay at all, but a staging ground for Cylon forces.

Recognizing that they are outnumbered four to one, Colonels Fisk and Belzen recommend the immediate recovery of Blue Squadron, and a swift retreat from the area. However, in a surprise move, Cain orders the remaining Vipers launched to provide cover-fire for Blue Squadron as they make a run at the relay. When Belzen officially refuses to carry out this order, Cain asks him to hand over his sidearm, whereupon she shoots him in the head with it. A shocked Fisk, fearing the same fate should he refuse the admiral's orders, immediately deploys all reserve Vipers.

As the Vipers commence their attack, Cylon operative Gina Inviere covertly takes the Pegasus weapons grid off-line, permitting two Cylon Heavy Raiders to access the port landing alcove with a Centurion boarding party. In an attempt to hold off the enemy boarding party, Cain orders the surrounding sections of Pegasus to be vented of atmosphere, hoping that the resulting vacuum will subdue the Cylons. The tactic is unsuccessful, and the Centurions make their way into the ship.

While investigating the sudden collapse of the battlestar's weapons grid, Lieutenant Shaw spots a Number Six among the advancing Cylon boarding party, and deduces that Inviere must be an enemy agent. She pulls a rifle from the grasp of a dead marine and fires at the surprised Six. After shooting the Cylon, Shaw returns to CIC, and reveals Inviere's true nature by displaying a security feed of the killed Six. When Marines try to apprehend Inviere on Cain's orders, she breaks the neck of one and uses his sidearm to shoot another. When Inviere hesitates as she aims at Cain, Shaw knocks the Cylon unconscious with the end of her rifle [2].

Additional details of the battle are unknown, but the communications station is presumably destroyed while Pegasus escapes with severe losses - 32 Vipers are destroyed, while 61 are badly damaged with not enough resources to repair them all (TRS: &quot;Pegasus&quot;; &quot;Razor&quot;)</text>

Battlestar Galactica Online is an online MMORPG that is completely based on space combat.

==Character Creation==

Since this is an MMO, you can create your character and interact with other real people. You may choose Human or Cylon as your race, and you get the missions, ships, and NPC alignment applicable to either race/faction.

==Familiar Faces.==

Many of the NPCs are familiar faces: Admiral Adama (The Old Man), Starbuck (both the Cylon and Human versions), Apollo, and Chief Tyrol, are among others the NPCs of the game. </text>

But as they download the info, they can see each other's memories. Tyrol is made aware that Tory murdered his wife, Cally, and kills her in revenge before the downloading is complete. Feeling betrayed, the Cylons resume fighting; after the other Cylons in CIC are killed, Cavil commits suicide. In the debris field, a chance rock strike causes Racetrack's hand to fall on the launch button for her Raptor's nuclear weapons; the missiles strike directly into the colony, knocking it out of orbit. With Galactica being dragged toward the singularity along with the colony, Adama orders Starbuck to jump the ship away, anywhere. Starbuck finds herself entering coordinates into the computer as if she were playing a song, using the notes which Hera had written. Galactica jumps away and out of danger, leaving the colony to inevitably fall to its destruction within the black hole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Galactica arrives at Kara's mysterious coordinates, its final destination as the damage caused in the battle has rendered the ship incapable of surviving any further jumps. Miraculously, the Galactica finds itself in orbit around a habitable world: our own Earth. Hours later, the rest of the fleet has been summoned. Lee makes the unorthodox suggestion that they abandon their technology and start afresh, while Adama and others discover primitive humans already occupying the planet. Since finding Earth was always the goal of the Colonial Fleet, Adama suggests they call this planet Earth. The survivors - Galactica's crew, the remaining inhabitants of the fleet, and the Cylon Twos, Sixes and Eights - take basic supplies and spread out across the planet - not to colonize it but to blend in with primitive early humans, leaving Anders to fly the fleet into the Sun. The decision was made not to colonize this time, but to break the cycle. &quot;All this has happened before...&quot; but maybe it won't happen again. Leave it all behind and start over. &quot;We can give them the best part of ourselves, but not the baggage&quot;. The Rebel Cylons decide that their Centurions have earned their freedom, and give them control of the Basestar, which jumps away to parts unknown. Starbuck, her destiny completed, literally vanishes without a trace after saying goodbye to Lee. &lt;p style=&quot;color:rgb(68,68,68);font-family:HelveticaNeue,HelveticaNeue,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:19px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:rgb(213,212,212);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:21px;&quot;&gt;Baltar and Caprica Six are visited by their Inner messengers, who inform them that their destinies - to save Hera - have been fulfilled, and the two decide to live out the rest of their lives together. Lee expresses his desire to venture off and explore the planet. Tyrol decides to settle by himself on a remote northern island (implied to be the Scottish highlands). Helo, Athena and Hera are reunited as a family. Tigh and Ellen stay with the rest of the survivors. Adama leaves with Roslin, but while admiring the wildlife and looking for a place to build a cabin for them, Roslin dies peacefully. Adama finds the place where he will build the cabin, and buries Laura on a nearby hillside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3932">[[File:Brother_john_cavil.jpg|thumb]]

John Cavil, aka Number One, is a humanoid Cylon model that appears as a highly rational, eccentric man in his late-sixties. Cavils have a heavy sarcastic demeanor and a sense of humor. They take neither religion nor death seriously and are the only atheist Cylon model. A Cavil is first seen aboard the Galactica assuming the role of a priest, offering spiritual guidance, and going by the name &quot;Brother Cavil&quot;.

One of the unique characteristics of the Cavils is the sadistic, cruel and Machiavellian streak in their personalities. Cavils openly mock their fellow Cylons every time they attempt contact with humans, even when it is absolutely necessary.

Viewing death as a nuisance, Cavils, however, are extremely displeased with pain (placing the blame on the Final Five). This view fuels the idea that Cavils wanted death to the humans to be as quick as possible, but were unprepared for the aftermath. Their attitude towards mankind's mortality, rather than irrational hatred, derives from their overall lack of knowledge about absolute death and the consequences that it carries. As revealed onBattlestar Galactica: The Plan, the Cavil that was stationed in Caprica learns from Samuel Anders the motives for the resistance; that humans do not leave anyone behind, even their dead. Respecting their resilience, the Caprica Cavil agrees with Caprica Six and Sharon Valerii (Boomer) to abandon the Colonies. Disappointed with the other Cylon models after failing to accomplish anything through boycott and sabotage, the Galactica Cavil fails to learn any lesson. As they are discovered and airlocked from Galactica, Galactica Cavil swears to &quot;box&quot; Caprica Cavil for his insubordination and is indicated to be the same Cavil that is the main enemy of season four given his plans to destroy humanity once and for all once he resurrects.

It is later implied in the series that the Cavils, akin to their creators, lack superhuman strength, and are actually the least likely to defend themselves. It is also implied that the Cavil who led the Civil War, and who killed himself in the CIC when he realized he was losing and had no chance of winning, is the resurrected Galactica Cavil.[citation needed] Like the Simons and Number Threes, and in contrast to Leobens, Dorals, Number Sixes, and Number Eights, Cavils appear to be relatively uncommon and never appear in large groups.

The Cavils' superior awareness of all situations (attributable to their being the only human model Cylon with full knowledge of their origin) and uncanny manipulative traits make their series the de facto leaders of the Cylons. However, their vast superiority and manipulations over their fellow Cylons goes beyond comprehension, as they manage to annihilate the Twelve Colonies and repeatedly attack the survivors without hurting the Final Five, and ensure their survival only to make them 'the ones who suffer the most', and basically carrying on with the annihilation of billions only to teach their creators a lesson.

A comment made by Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii indicates the Cavils are against the idea of the Cylons reproducing themselves biologically, which makes sense given their distaste for human traits as well as lack of faith in the Cylon god, whose commandments include, &quot;Be fruitful.&quot; Ellen Tigh also mentions that the idea that the only hope for the future of the Cylon race might be 'messy biological reproduction' is too much for Cavil.

Cavil is very insistent the Cylons not seek out or discuss the Final Five models. He also actively tries to prevent D'Anna from learning their identities, even threatening her at gunpoint in &quot;Rapture&quot;. After she sees their faces, he boxes her before she can tell anyone, while claiming support from the other Cylons. The reason is he knows the identities of the Final Five and doesn't want them exposed (he’s waiting until they've learned their &quot;lesson.&quot;)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">[[File:OperaHouse_inside.jpg|thumb|Inside the Opera House.]]

The Opera House is an ancient structure in the [[City of the Gods]] on [[Kobol]], along with other edifices such as the [[Forum]] and [[Temple]]. By the time of the arrival of the Colonials, the building has been reduced to a few scattered ruins. As a sketch of this area of the city is included in the [[Sacred Scrolls]], the building may have had religious significance.
==First Sight==

These are the ruins on Kobol near the crash site of [[Raptor 1]], which is forced to land on the planet after being damaged by a [[Cylon Raider]] as it jumps into Kobol's orbit. Among the surviving passengers are [[Crashdown]], [[Galen Tyrol]], [[Tarn]], [[Seelix]], [[Cally]], [[Socinus]], and [[Gaius Baltar]].
==Baltar and Three==

Shortly after the Raptor crash on Kobol, the virtual [[Number Six]] in a white dress leads Baltar towards the ruins of the Opera House, where viewers and Baltar see the Opera House as it was, millennia ago. It is in that virtual Opera House that Six shows Baltar an image of what she claims is their future child ([[Kobol's Last Gleaming, Part II]]).

Much later a [[Number Three]] would have similar visions of the Opera House and the [[Final Five]] on the stage within. The Five appear as robed figures to her between death and resurrection, but she cannot clearly remember their faces until she steps onto the centerpiece in the [[Temple of Five]] and has the vision for the final time ([[Rapture]]).

== Roslin, Sharon, Hera, and Caprica-Six ==

The Opera House is also seen in a dream or vision by President [[Laura Roslin]], induced by taking of [[chamalla]]. In the vision, [[Hera Agathon]] is scampering through the halls, pursued by both Roslin and her mother, [[Sharon Agathon]]. But before either can reach her, Hera is picked up by a [[Number Six]] wearing a white dress, ending the dream ([[Crossroads, Part I]]).

Just before the Fleet reaches the [[Ionian nebula]], Roslin visits the Opera House again while undergoing her [[Doloxan]] treatment (but still using chamalla as well) in [[sickbay]]. She and Sharon are still chasing Hera through the lobby. This time, however, when the Number Six picks the child up, she takes her through a set of doors. Roslin wakes up with to find that Sharon and Hera shared the vision, all three having awakened screaming simultaneously. Agathon and Roslin visit the captive [[Caprica-Six]], who confirms that she, too, had shared the dream.

At the Ionian nebula, Caprica-Six has yet another vision in the Opera House, where she, [[Gaius Baltar]], and baby Hera stand on the stage and see the robed Final Five standing on the balcony above them ([[Crossroads, Part II]]).

It is prophesied by the rebel's Hybrid that the &quot;dying leader shall know the truth of the Opera House&quot; ([[Faith]]).

Later, Sharon Agathon runs after Hera through Galactica's hallways, where Hera runs into a Six known as Natalie, thus mirroring what she saw in her visions of the Opera House. Fearing that Natalie will take away her daughter, like the Six in the dreams, Agathon shoots the other Cylon ([[Guess What's coming to Dinner?]]).

During the [[Battle of The Colony]], as Cylon Centurions board Galactica, the vision is paralleled in actual events. Hera runs away from her parents when [[Karl Agathon]] is shot in the leg, and [[Sharon Agathon]] abandons him to go after her. At the same time, Roslin leaves her post at the sickbay when she begins to have the Opera House dream again. Eventually, just as the vision showed, Caprica-Six and Baltar find Hera and take her into what they perceive as the Opera House, which is, in actuality, Galactica's [[Combat Information Center]] (CIC). The Final Five cylons stand above them on one of the higher levels, looking down upon Baltar and Caprica Six, just as the vision foretold. ([[Daybreak, Part II]])</text>

The '''Galactica Type Battlestar''' is the first [[Battlestar|Battlestar class]] to be constructed over the twelve colonies. During the [[First Cylon War]] only twelve battlestars were constructed and each of them represents the Twelve Colonies of Kobol. One of these ships is the [[Galactica|Battlestar Galactica]], first to be commanded by [[Silas Nash|Commander Silas Nash]]. Each of these battlestars were the lead ships of [[Battlestar Group|Battlestar Groups]] during the first cylon war.

==Technology &amp; Combat Characteristics==

These colonial capital ships were designed to be a hybrid between an aircraft carrier and a battleship. The Battlestars of this class had a full viper and raptor compliment, also they were armed [[Battery|with large anti-ship gun batteries]] and point defense batteries. 

==Timeline==

==Ships of the Line==
